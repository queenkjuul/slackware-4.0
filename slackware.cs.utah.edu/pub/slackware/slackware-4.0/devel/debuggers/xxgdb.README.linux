This is a port of xxgdb 1.08 for Linux.

I did a lot of cleanup on the "calldbx.c" module to fix the annoying 
"[tcsetpgrp failed in terminal_inferior: Not a typewriter]" bug.

Quick Installation Notes:

- Set BINDIR and LIBDIR in the Imakefile.
- Set XFILESEARCHPATH in xdbx.c so that xxgdb can find its app-defaults file.
- Create the Makefile with the "xmkmf" command.
- make all install

Have a nice day.
