Dasm is a rich macro assembler for the 6502, 68705, 6803/HD6303 and
the 68HC11.  I've been using it to great success for about three
years.  It was written by Matt Dillon for the Amiga; I've ported it to
both MSDOS and Linux.  Here's my Linux port.

For now, this software should be considered beta, although I've used
it to rebuild my two major commercial products without error.
