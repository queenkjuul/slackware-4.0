3 Apr 93: Recompiled everything with -static, because Scott Musman
  pointed out that si::faslink did not work with a different version
  of shared libraries. faslink now supplies -static to the linker.
5 Apr 93: added collectfn to the binary distribution (in /usr/local/akcl/cmpnew)
  because pcl requires it.
10 Apr 93: Recompiled with libc-4.3.3
26 Apr 93: added support for (listen) , after a suggestion
  by Scott Musman. CLX now works !
