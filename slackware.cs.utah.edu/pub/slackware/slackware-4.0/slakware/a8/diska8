lilo:
lilo:     Generic Boot Loader for Linux ('LInux LOader') by Werner Almesberger.
lilo:     LILO boots Linux from your hard drive. It can also boot other
lilo:     operating systems such as MS-DOS and OS/2, and can even boot DOS from
lilo:     the second hard drive. LILO comes with utilities and documentation
lilo:     that make it easier to install, such as 'liloconfig' and 'QuickStart'.
lilo:     NOTE: Installing boot loaders is inherently dangerous. Be sure to have
lilo:     some means to boot your system from a different media if you install
lilo:     LILO on your hard disk.
