apsfilt:  apsfilter-5.0.1.
apsfilt:
apsfilt:  Apsfilter is a printer input filter.  With apsfilter installed and
apsfilt:  configured, you can print many different file types (like ASCII,
apsfilt:  PostScript, and DVI, as well as compressed versions of all of these)
apsfilt:  directly with 'lpr', and apsfilter will automatically handle the
apsfilt:  conversion process on the fly.
apsfilt:
apsfilt:  To configure apsfilter, run the SETUP program in /usr/lib/apsfilter.

ash:      Kenneth Almquist's ash shell.
ash:
ash:      A lightweight (62K) Bourne compatible shell.  Great for machines with
ash:      low memory, but does not provide all the extras of shells like bash,
ash:      tcsh, and zsh.  Runs most shell scripts compatible with the Bourne
ash:      shell.  Note that under Linux, most scripts seem to use at least some
ash:      bash-specific syntax.  The Slackware setup scripts are a notable
ash:      exception, since ash is the shell used on the install disks.  NetBSD
ash:      uses ash as its /bin/sh.

bc:
bc:       bc is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with 
bc:       interactive execution of statements.  There are some similarities in
bc:       the syntax to the C programming language.

enscript: GNU enscript 1.6.1
enscript:
enscript: Enscript converts text files to PostScript and spools the generated
enscript: output to a printer or saves it to a file.  If no input files are
enscript: given, enscript processes standard input.  Enscript can be extended to
enscript: handle different output media and it has many options for customizing
enscript: printouts.

groff:
groff:    The groff package provides versions of troff, nroff, eqn, tbl, and 
groff:    other Unix text-formatting utilities.  Groff is used to 'compile' man
groff:    pages stored in groff/nroff format into a form which can be printed or
groff:    displayed on the screen.  These man pages are stored in compressed
groff:    form in the /usr/man/man? directories.

ispell:   ispell-3.1.20
ispell:
ispell:   Ispell is a fast screen-oriented spelling checker that shows you your
ispell:   errors in the context of the original file, and suggests possible 
ispell:   corrections when it can figure them out.  Compared to UNIX spell, it
ispell:   is faster and much easier to use.  Ispell can also handle languages
ispell:   other than English.  Ispell has a long history, and many people have
ispell:   contributed to the current version -- some of the major contributors
ispell:   include R. E. Gorin, Pace Willisson, Walt Buehring, and Geoff 
ispell:   Kuenning.

jpeg6:    Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software version 6b
jpeg6:
jpeg6:    Software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression.  JPEG
jpeg6:    (pronounced 'jay-peg') is a standardized compression method for 
jpeg6:    full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
jpeg6:    'real-world' scenes; cartoons and other non-realistic images are not
jpeg6:    its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, however, on typical images of 
jpeg6:    real-world scenes, very good compression levels can be obtained with
jpeg6:    no visible change, and amazingly high compression levels are possible
jpeg6:    if you can tolerate a low-quality image.

mt_st:    mt-st-0.4 - controls magnetic tape drive operation
mt_st:
mt_st:    This mt originates from BSD NET-2.  Some Linux SCSI tape-specific
mt_st:    ioctls have been added to the original source and the man page has
mt_st:    been updated.  Although this mt program is tailored for SCSI tape, it
mt_st:    can also be used with the QIC-02 driver and hopefully with other Linux
mt_st:    tape drivers using the same ioctls (some of the commands may not work
mt_st:    with all drivers).

quota:    Linux disk quota utilities (1.70)
quota:
quota:    An implementation of the diskquota system for the Linux operating
quota:    system -- keeps those greedy users from gobbling up 100% of the hard
quota:    drive space.  Should work for all filesystems because of integration 
quota:    into the VFS layer of the operating system.  This system is a heavily
quota:    modified version of the Melbourne quota system by Robert Elz, which
quota:    uses both user and group quota files.  Edvard Tuinder <ed@ow.org> and
quota:    Marco van Wieringen <mvw@planets.ow.org> are responsible for the 
quota:    additional code and porting effort to make quotas work on Linux.

zsh:      command-line editor, options for customizing its behavior, filename
zsh:      globbing, features to make C-shell (csh) users feel more at home and
zsh:      extra features drawn from tcsh (another 'custom' shell).  Zsh was
