oldlibs5:
oldlibs5: These are a.out format libraries that are mostly obsolete by now, but
oldlibs5: are retained in case you encounter one of the a.out X11R5 X binaries
oldlibs5: that are still floating around.

xs3:      An accelerated server for cards using S3 chips.
xs3:
xs3:      The current S3 Server supports all available S3 chipsets: 911, 924,
xs3:      801/805, 928, 732 (Trio32), 764, 765, 775, 785 (Trio64*), 864, 868,
xs3:      964, 968 and M65 (Aurora64V+).  However, this does not mean that all
xs3:      S3 boards will work -- see the XFree86 docs for complete information.
xs3:      The S3 server will also recognise the 866, but it has not been tested
xs3:      with this chipset.  Installing this package will create a link in
xs3:      /usr/X11R6/bin from XF86_S3 to X, setting this server as the default.
xs3:
xs3:
xs3v:     An accelerated server for cards using S3 ViRGE chips.
xs3v:
xs3v:     The current XF86_S3V server supports the S3 ViRGE (86C325), the
xs3v:     ViRGE/DX (86C375), ViRGE/GX (86C385) and the ViRGE/VX (86C988) chips.
xs3v:     It has been tested with ViRGE cards with 2 and 4MB DRAM, ViRGE/DX 4M,
xs3v:     ViRGE/VX 8M (4M VRAM/4M DRAM), and with a 220MHz ViRGE/VX card with
xs3v:     2MB VRAM up to 1600x1200 with 8/15/16bpp.  Note that the XF86_SVGA
xs3v:     server also supports these chipsets (and others).  It's recommended to
xs3v:     try using that first.  Installing this package will create a link in
xs3v:     /usr/X11R6/bin from XF86_S3V to X, setting this server as the default.

xvfb:     Virtual framebuffer X server.
xvfb:
xvfb:     Xvfb is an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
xvfb:     and no physical input devices.  It emulates a dumb framebuffer using 
xvfb:     virtual memory.  The primary use of this server is intended to be 
xvfb:     server testing.  The mfb or cfb code for any depth can be exercised
xvfb:     with this server without the need for real hardware that supports the
xvfb:     desired depths.  A secondary use is testing clients against unusual
xvfb:     depths and screen configurations.

xvg16:    A server for 16 color EGA/VGA graphics modes.
xvg16:
xvg16:    This is a server that uses standard generic video modes -- it works
xvg16:    with nearly all video hardware (but with only 16 colors).  Installing
xvg16:    this package will create a link in /usr/X11R6/bin from XF86_VGA16 to
xvg16:    X, setting this server as the default.

xw32:     A server for chipsets in the ET4000/W32 series.
xw32:
xw32:     This server currently supports the w32, w32i, w32p and et6000 chips.
xw32:     XF86_W32 gets phased out, now that the SVGA server with XAA 
xw32:     acceleration is at least as fast as the W32 server but supports more
xw32:     cards and higher color depths.  Use this server if the SVGA server
xw32:     fails to work/accelerate for you.
xw32:
xw32:     Installing this package will create a link in /usr/X11R6/bin from

xaw3d:    S. Keithley based on the R6.3 Athena Widget set.  The Three-D Athena
xaw3d:    may be used as a replacement for the Athena (Xaw) Widget set -- you
xaw3d:    may relink almost any Athena Widget based application and obtain a
xaw3d:    three dimensional appearance on some of the widgets.  You can also
xaw3d:    replace your shared libXaw with libXaw3d and obtain the three
xaw3d:    dimensional appearance without even relinking.
