linuxinc: Linux 2.2.6 kernel include files.
linuxinc:
linuxinc: These are the include files from the 2.2.6 Linux kernel.  You'll
linuxinc: need these to compile most system (and other) software for Linux.
linuxinc: These include files are also part of the Linux kernel source package,
linuxinc: and this package is also included with the D (development) software
linuxinc: series.  This redundancy is intentional, since the kernel sources
linuxinc: use quite a bit of disk space, it's useful to be able to easily
linuxinc: remove the Linux kernel sources without disturbing the kernel include
linuxinc: files.
