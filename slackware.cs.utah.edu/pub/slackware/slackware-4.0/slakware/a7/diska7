ldso:     ld.so 1.9.9, the dynamic linker/loader.
ldso:
ldso:     ld.so completes the final process of linking all necessary references
ldso:     to sharable objects and unreferenced symbols in an impure executable,
ldso:     (usually a dynamically linked executable), to produce a runnable file.
ldso:     Nearly all Linux binaries are 'incomplete' and require further linking
ldso:     at run time. ld.so's job is thus to complete the linking process 
ldso:     started at compilation. ld.so was written by David Engel, 
ldso:     Eric Youngdale, Peter MacDonald, Hongjiu Lu, Linus Torvalds,
ldso:     Lars Wirzenius and Mitch D'Souza.

less:     less-332
less:
less:     Less is a paginator similar to more (1), but which allows backward
less:     movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does not
less:     have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large
less:     input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi (1).
