Yes, this "disk" is oversized.  For a floppy install, put the "install.end"
file that you find here on the previous disk and use that as the last disk in
the N series.  Once the system is installed you can add the oversized packages
with "installpkg".  (Once you've figured out a way to get them on the hard
drive :)
