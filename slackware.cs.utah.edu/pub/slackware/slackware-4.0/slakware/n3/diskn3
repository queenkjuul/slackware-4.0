smailcfg: Configuration files for sendmail.
smailcfg:
smailcfg: These files are used to create sendmail.cf configuration files.  The
smailcfg: m4 macro processor (on the D series of disks) is also required in
smailcfg: order to make use of these files. 
smailcfg:
smailcfg: These files and the documentation in /usr/src/sendmail should make it
smailcfg: possible to support virtually any mail configuration.  NOTE: you
smailcfg: probably won't need this package if you're planning to use one of the
smailcfg: sendmail.cf samples included in the sendmail package.
