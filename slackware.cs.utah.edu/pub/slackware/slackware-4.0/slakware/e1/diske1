elisp:    Emacs lisp source files.
elisp:
elisp:    This package contains source code for the parts of Emacs that are
elisp:    written in Emacs Lisp.  *.el files are Emacs Lisp source, and the
elisp:    corresponding *.elc files are byte-compiled versions.
elisp:
elisp:    The emacsbin.tgz package contains all of the *.el files that emacs
elisp:    requires to run, but these are probably good to have if you've got
elisp:    the space on your hard drive.

emac_nox: Emacs binary without X support.
emac_nox:
emac_nox: A replacement /usr/bin/emacs binary that is not compiled with X11 menu
emac_nox: support.  This version of emacs is about 400K smaller than the full
emac_nox: version of emacs, and is the same in every respect except for X11
emac_nox: extensions.  It can still run in an xterm or rxvt if you wish to run
emac_nox: it under X, but it is mainly included for those folks who don't have X
emac_nox: (or the X11, Xaw, and Xt shared libs) installed on their machines.
emac_nox: You might want to remove the version that requires X if you install
emac_nox: and use this one.

emacsbin:
emacsbin: Base binaries and support files for the GNU Emacs editor/environment.
emacsbin: This version supports X.  If you do not have X installed, you will

emacsbin: require the X11, Xaw, and Xt libraries from XFree86.
