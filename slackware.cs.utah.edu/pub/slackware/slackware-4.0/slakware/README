This directory contains the primary Slackware packages -- the ones that
actually install files to your hard drive.  You can install these packages
with "setup", "pkgtool", or "installpkg".  See the man pages (man installpkg)
for details.

Share Slackware with your friends!  Just use the quick and easy disk
mastering utility in this directory, and you can make installable
3.5" Linux disk sets.  NOTE: Only the A and N series will fit on (and can be
installed from) floppy disks at this point (and the last N disk with samba must
be skipped until later).  In the other software series directories, larger
software packages were growing to the point where fragmenting them to fit on
floppy disks was no longer practical.  But, these days it's pretty easy to
dump all of the packages onto a Zip or Jaz disk, or burn them onto a CD-R.
That's probably more likely to work without failure than a stack of 100+
floppy disks, too.

Have fun!
