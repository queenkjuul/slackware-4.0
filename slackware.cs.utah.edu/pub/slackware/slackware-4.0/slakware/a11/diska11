modutils: modutils-2.1.121
modutils:
modutils: Utilities to use kernel modules.  These tools are used for loading
modutils: and unloading chunks of kernel code on the fly, to add support for a
modutils: CD-ROM drive or ethernet card, for instance.
modutils:
modutils: Many Linux drivers are provided as kernel modules, and some packages
modutils: (like the PCMCIA package) require the module utilities to work, so you
modutils: probably want to install these.

pcmcia:   pcmcia-cs-3.0.9
pcmcia:
pcmcia:   Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package.  It
pcmcia:   includes a set of loadable kernel modules that implement a version of
pcmcia:   the PCMCIA Card Services applications program interface, a set of
pcmcia:   client drivers for specific cards, and a card manager daemon that can
pcmcia:   respond to card insertion and removal events, loading and unloading
pcmcia:   drivers on demand.  It supports ``hot swapping'' of PCMCIA cards, so
pcmcia:   cards can be inserted and ejected at any time.

pnp:      isapnptools-1.18
pnp:
pnp:      These programs allow ISA Plug-And-Play devices to be
pnp:      configured on a Linux machine.  See the documentation in 
pnp:      /usr/doc/isapnptools-1.18.

sysvinit: sysvinit-2.76-3
sysvinit:
sysvinit: System V style init programs by Miquel van Smoorenburg that control
sysvinit: the booting and shutdown of your system. These support a number of
sysvinit: system runlevels, each with a specific set of utilities spawned. For
sysvinit: example, the normal system runlevel is 3, which starts agetty on
sysvinit: virtual consoles tty1 - tty6. Runlevel 4 starts xdm. Runlevel 0 shuts
sysvinit: the system down. See the documentation in /usr/doc/sysvinit and the
sysvinit: scripts in /etc/rc.d for more information.
