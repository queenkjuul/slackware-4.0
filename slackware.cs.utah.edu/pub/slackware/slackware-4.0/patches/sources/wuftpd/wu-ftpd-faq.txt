              6. I want a real user to be able to access the host only
                 via ftp, not via telnet
              7. Somebody uploaded a file with a weird name

                 mounted incoming
             14. Normal ftp clients work, Netscape ftp's fail. So,
                 passive mode doesn't work.
             15. I made a symbolic link within the anonymous tree and it
                 doesn't work for the anonymous users.
             16. I want to redirect anonymous users to another machine
             17. ftpd stops accepting connections when a lot of
                 connections come in.
             18. Running wu-ftpd on a *large* site
             19. Only the first 8 characters of the anonymous username
                 are recieved by the server.
             20. wu-ftpd fails with '500 Illegal PORT Command' under AIX
                 4.3 or Solaris 8
             21. I want to host multiple ftp servers on the same machine
             22. I just upgraded and now nobody can log in. It worked
                 before.
             23. I get disconnected directly from the ftp server.
             24. Mirror breaks with wu-ftpd 2.6.0.
             25. Logins to the ftp server take a long time, after that
                 things run smooth
             26. ls doesn't show anything except files. It does not show
                 directories and links
             27. My client hangs at the end of a transfer
             28. Sometimes ftpd stops working and inetd logs 'ftp/tcp
                 server failing (looping), service terminated'
             29. I can't login, in the syslog is: get passwd; pwdb:
                 request not recognized
        12. Other things
              1. Where is the FTP protocol documented ?
              2. How can I make my ftp-archive accessible by Email

                 for the WU-FTPD Development team's consideration
              3. I have what I believe to be a critical security problem
                 with the daemon and don't want to talk about it via
                 email. Can I call someone on the telephone
    2. What is this document
       This is the FAQ (frequently asked questions) for newer versions of
       wu-ftpd as maintained at ftp.wu-ftpd.org. This document is an
       addition to the manpages of wu-ftpd which are part of the
       installation and available online as
       <URL:http://www.wu-ftpd.org/man/>.
       Answer number one is: Update to the latest version (at this
       moment: 2.6.1). A lot of problems have been fixed, including
       security problems.

         1. What is the intended audience for this document
            This document (and wu-ftpd in general) need a general
            knowledge of Unix system management aimed at the Unix version
            you are trying to install wu-ftpd on. Subjects like user
            management, password management, filesystem management,
            changing access settings and chroot environments are
            prerequisite knowledge. Reviews of books about Unix in

       working on it or supporting it!) wu-ftpd is the most popular ftp
       daemon on the Internet, used on many anonymous ftp sites all
       around the world.
         1. What is the license status for wu-ftpd ?
            The correct answer to this is in the the 'LICENSE' file which
            comes with the source tree and is available online as
            <URL:http://www.wu-ftpd.org/license.html>

    4. Where do I get the wu-ftpd ?
       The original wu-ftpd home is wuarchive.wustl.edu, but at this
       moment wuarchive no longer supports or maintains wu-ftpd. The
       correct location at this moment for wu-ftpd is
       ftp://ftp.wu-ftpd.org/pub/wu-ftpd/ (please use a real ftp client
       to access this).

         1. Where do I get the latest version ?
            The wa-ftpd development group maintains wu-ftpd and makes the
            latest version available at ftp.wu-ftpd.org in
            ftp://ftp.wu-ftpd.org/pub/wu-ftpd/ (please use ftp to access
            this). This version of wu-ftpd is now actively maintained by
            the wu-ftpd developers group, reachable by email as
            (wuftpd-dev@wu-ftpd.org).
         2. What were the VR patches for wu-ftpd ?
            The VR-series offered a number of enhancements and bug fixes
            not available in the base version. The VR patches have been
            integrated in wu-ftpd 2.5.0 and the will not be available
            from ftp.vr.net after the end of August 1999.
         3. What is BeroFTPD ?
            BeroFTPD was a derivative of wu-ftpd with extra functionality
            for virtual hosts. Patches from the VR versions were
            included. The enhancments from BeroFTPD are now incorporated
            into the main daemon.
         4. PGP verification of the package fails!
            The signature has been made with a newer pgp. You need a
            recent pgp to get the right answer.
    5. Compiling the wu-ftpd
       In wu-ftpd 2.6.0, GNU autoconf is introduced, but it's still in
       experimental stage. So first try ./configure and if that fails try
       the old method:
       In general, editing src/pathnames.h and typing build arch should
       be enough.
         1. cc complains about strunames, typenames, modenames, .. being
            undeclared.
            This error is fully explained in the INSTALL/INSTALL.orig
            file in wu-ftpd package. A few relevant lines :
If cc complains about strunames, typenames, modenames, ... being undefined
you need to install support/ftp.h as /usr/include/arpa/ftp.h (always make
a backup of the old ftp.h just in case!) and do the build again.  The new
ftp.h should be a compatible superset of your existing ftp.h, so you
shouldn't have problems with this replacement.
         2. I don't have yacc
            Replace yacc with bison -y in the Makefile.
         3. wu-ftpd doesn't 'see' that users are in multiple groups.
            This is fixed in recent versions (2.6.1). Upgrade now.
         4. I get "conflicting types for `realpath'"
            This is fixed in recent versions (2.6.1). Upgrade now.
         5. wu-ftpd doesn't use the shadow passwords on my Linux machine.
            Upgrade to version 2.6.1 or later. They automatically use
            shadow passwords when available. If this gives problems, you
            might want to upgrade your Linux. For older versions:
            Since older Linux distributions (around libc.5.3 this got
            fixed) don't include shadow passwords, wu-ftpd might assume
            your Linux does not have shadow passwords. To compile for
            shadow passwords with Linux when this happens :
               o Get the shadow.h from the latest shadow package.
               o After building the shadow package, you have a
                 libshadow.a.
               o Copy shadow.h to the src dir.
               o Copy libshadow.a to the support dir.
               o Edit src/config.h to say '#define SHADOW_PASSWORD'
                 instead of #undef.
               o Edit the LIBES line in src/Makefile to read :
                 LIBES = -lsupport -lbsd -lshadow (for some releases,
                 -lcrypt is also needed)
            Modify src/ftpd.c around line 1061 to read :
        xpasswd = pw_encrypt(passwd, salt);
         6. It doesn't compile at all on newer Linux installs. The error
            is :
            Upgrade to version 2.6.1
         7. The timezone in the xferlog is wrong
            Either, you compiled with support for setting the process
            title (SPT_TYPE) on a machine that doesn't support this,
            where changing the process title clobbers the environment and
            therefore zaps the TZ variable. Recompile with SPT_TYPE set
            to SPT_NONE.
            Systems which don't support SPT_TYPE : Aix, SGI Irix
            Or, you need to copy the zoneinfo files to the ~ftp tree too.
            These are :
/etc/TIMEZONE
/etc/default/init
/etc/localtime (FreeBSD)
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/..
            The name of the correct file in /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo
            depends on your current timezone. Exact filenames depend on
            your operating system too. See the manpages for timezone(4)
            and zic(1M).
         8. The timezone in the ls output is wrong
            See above, but also check if your system needs
            /etc/default/init (Solaris 2.5 for example) for setting the
            correct TZ variable. This file has to be in chrooted
            environments too then.
            Noted by Francois Belanger (francois@goltier.com).
            Digital Unix needs /etc/zoneinfo/localtime.
         9. Digital Unix doesn't log commands after an anonymous user
            logs in
            Upgrade to version 2.6.1 or later.
        10. install fails with 'install: ..'
            The makefile is setup for the bsd version of the install
            program. Some OS'es (including Solaris) use the svr4 version.
            In that case set in the makefile :
            INSTALL = /usr/ucb/install
        11. Digital Unix (The Unix Formerly Known As OSF/1) and Enhanced
            C2 security,
            First, upgrade to version 2.6.1 or later. Then, make the
            changes noted in src/makefiles/Makefile.{dec,du4}.
        12. It doesn't compile at all on Digital Unix, errors about
            struct timeval
            Upgrade to version 2.6.1 or later.
        13. What should I do to be able to use wu-ftpd in a HP-UX 10.01
            Upgrade to version 2.6.1 or later. If you are not using C2
            security, you may need to change the definitions for
            SHADOW_PASSWORD and HPUX_10_TRUSTED.
            Some kernel configuration may be required to allow more heavy
            load on lock files and multiple access to the same file. This
            can all be done through SAM. An important thing to keep in
            mind on a heavily accessed machine is that the fin_wait state
            needs to be lowered enough to keep open file locks at a
            minimum.
        14. What should I do for HP-UX 10.10 to make it work completely.
            If the above doesn't work, some more notes :
/usr/include/shadow.h:  This *system* file had an apparent typo that caused
gcc to fail.  I changed the following statement:

     extern int lckpwdf(void),
            to
     extern int lckpwdf(void); <<--- note the ';'

realpath.c:  I think there was a external reference (maybe more than 1
reference?)  which did not match the internal declaration.  I think I
changed the realpath declaration to match the externals.  I deleted the
original sources so I don't recall the change exactly.

ftpcmd.c:  This file results from ftpcmd.y (via yacc/bison).  Unfortunately
the resulting c code will not build.  It was necessary to move 2 of the
structures to an earlier section.  I think it was the 'cmdtab[]' and
'sitetab[]' structures which were moved.  They were being called prior to
their declaration.  (`what bison` gives $Revision: 76.162.1.5 $)

Makefile.hpx:  Modified to not delete the ftpcmd.c file fixed above.

ftpd.c:  1) installed the shadow password patch per the instructions in the
FAQ.  The new code worked without any problems (I'll probably port it to
the POP3 server I've been wanting to install).  2) Modified the sprintf
calls near SEPPROCTITLE to include "wuftpd" in the process string (similar
to hp-ux ftpd).  this allows "ps -ef | grep ftp" to show all connected ftp
processes.  It might need a little doctoring up since the file names on
RETR have ^M^J tacked on.
            Notes provided by Chuck Davis (cdavis@wrair-amss.army.mil).
            Extra remark: On a trusted system HP's getpwnam does not
            supply the encrypted password. Instead you have to use
            getprpwnam. Modify ftpd.c to use getprpwnam.
         pr_pw = getprpwnam(pw->pw_name);      /* get shadow password */
         xpasswd = crypt(passwd, pr_pw->ufld.fd_encrypt);
         bpasswd = bigcrypt(passwd, pr_pw->ufld.fd_encrypt);
        15. Installation notes for HP-UX 10.20.
            A complete set of installation notes for wu-ftpd on HP-UX
            10.20:
            This section is written by someone else who wishes to remain
            unnamed.
            I installed wu-ftp2.4 on a clean HPUX 10.20 build. The 10.20
            build came straight from HP, and the only important
            differences on this build from a generic build is that the
            X-libs and X-utils were stripped out (something I would
            recommend if you are building an HP 10.20 for ftp only).
            - Get both the wu-ftp2.4 package and the current ansi-c
            compiler package (I got mine from HP, you can request the
            package ansic.hp-10.20.tar.gz)
            - Uncompress and untar the C package first (HP comes with a
            standard c compiler, but it is only useful in the kernel
            compiling and doesn't function well outside of doing kernel
            work). Follow the README/INSTALL docs for installing the c
            compiler. Make sure you put this new compiler in your path,
            or do some editing whenever you use cc to point to this
            compiler and not the default.
            - Build wu-ftpd normally
            - Set up the server
            - Special notes about tuning for heavy load: The ftp servers
            that I maintain are heavily hit and some kernel configuration
            was required to allow more heavy load on lock files and
            multiple access to the same file. This was all done through
            SAM. An important thing to keep in mind on a heavily accessed
            machine is that the fin_wait state needs to be lowered enough
            to keep open file locks at a minimum. I set all of my
            fin_waits to 5 minutes or less.
    6. Special compilation options/fixes
       This section deals with specialities in compilation for certain
       situations.
         1. I need to authenticate real users via AFS
            Edit the Makefile for your OS to add the AFS libs/includes.
            They only appear in the Makefile for AIX. Then, add the
            following line to the #include section of src/ftpd.c :
#include <afs/stds.h>
            Noted by Perry L. Morgan (pmorgan@uceng.uc.edu).
         2. I need to use S/KEY authorisation
            Method for 'configure' :
            (For Solaris 7 as noted by Justin Kurmaty (justin@pty.com):
1. copied skey.h /usr/include
2. copied libskey.a /usr/lib
3. ran configure --enable-skey
            Method for 'build' :
            Michael Brennen (mbrennen@fni.com) wrote on the list:
The general SKEY procedure is something like this:

The last thing in config.h is an #undef SKEY; comment that out.  That is
a gotcha that can take some time to find, although that doesn't seem to
be the problem.

Copy skey.h into the src directory.

Copy libskey.a into the support directory.

Edit the appropriate Makefile.* in src/makefiles and add the following:
   add "-DSKEY" to the CFLAGS macro;
   add "-lskey" to the LIBES macro.

That should do it; if not, holler back.
         3. I want to block certain default addresses (IE30User@,
            mozilla@)
            Check the option 'deny-mail' in the ftpaccess(5) manpage.
    7. Installing the wu-ftpd
       In general, change the line for the ftp-server in /etc/inetd.conf
       (the file that defines the servers started by inetd. For some
       operating systems, this is another file).
         1. Command-line options for wu-ftpd
            With the latest versions, using no command-line options will
            set it to a default-mode, in which it will not parse the
            ftpaccess file. Add the option -a to the command line in
            inetd.conf.
         2. Testing on a different port number then ftp:21
            This can be done from the command line or with a special
            definition in /etc/services / /etc/inetd.conf. For
            command-line, look up -P and -p in the ftpaccess(5) manpage.
            To set up with special definitions, add 2 ports with
            consecutive numbers in /etc/services, and then start wu-ftpd
            on these ports. Add to /etc/services something like :
ftptest         4021/tcp        #command port
ftptest-data    4020/tcp        #data port
            Then start wu-ftpd from /etc/inetd.conf like :
ftptest stream tcp nowait root /usr/etc/in.ftpd in.ftpd
            The key is the name 'ftptest' which associates the port
            assignment in the /etc/services file to that in the
            inetd.conf file. Make certain the choice of ports in
            /etc/services (4021 and 4020 above) are from the local use
            list and don't conflict with other port assignments (see
            RFC1700, ASSIGNED NUMBERS). One important subtlety. The data
            port is not really derived from the data port declaration in
            the /etc/services file. The FTP specification (RFC765) states
            the data port is defined as one less than the command port.
            However, including the data port declaration in the
            /etc/services file prevents it from being accidentally
            assigned to something else.
            From a mail by W. James Showalter (gamma@mintaka.disa.mil)
         3. Not all command line parameters seem to be used by wu-ftpd
            Your inetd probably drops some parameters after a given
            number (4 or 5). You can use the following wrapper program to
            give additional parameters :
/* wrapper for wuftpd to add command line arguments
   that don't fit under inetd */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <syslog.h>

int main(argc,argv)
   int argc;
   char **argv;
{
   char *path="/local-adm/bin/ftpd";
   char *cmd="ftpd";

   fflush(stderr);
   fflush(stdout);
   errno=0;
   execl(path,cmd,"-a","-l","-L","-u022",NULL);

   openlog("wrapftpd",LOG_PID, LOG_LOCAL6);
   syslog(LOG_WARNING,(const char *)strerror(errno));
   closelog();
   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

}
            Code from Albert Lunde (Albert-Lunde@nwu.edu)
         4. How do I use the package file
            WUFtpd250.wu-ftpd-2.5.0.SPARC.ULTRASparc.2.5.1.2.5.pkg.tar ?
            Unpack the tar into an empty directory which will then have a
            subdirectory named WUFtpd250 Do not enter this directory, but
            type 'pkgadd -d .', you will get something like:
# pkgadd -d .

The following packages are available:
  1  WUFtpd250     wu-ftpd 2.5.0 SPARC/ULTRAsparc 2.5.1 - 2.5
                   (sun4c,sun4d,sun4e,sun4m,sun4u,sun4u1) 2.5.0

Select package(s) you wish to process (or 'all' to process
all packages). (default: all) [?,??,q]:
    8. Are there year 2000 issues with wu-ftpd?
       The original version of wu-ftpd had a year 2000 representation
       problem in the handling of the MDTM (modification time of file)
       command. No internal workings of wu-ftpd were affected by this
       problem.
       This problem has been fixed in wu-ftpd 2.4.2 beta 14 which was
       published August 1997. With this fix, wu-ftpd is believed to be
       completely Y2K-compliant.
       The fix that was applied :
       The following statement appears in ftpcmd.y. It is part of the
       action for the syntax: MDTM check_login SP pathname CRLF
                reply(213,
                        "19%02d%02d%02d%02d%02d%02d",
                        t->tm_year, t->tm_mon+1, t->tm_mday,
                        t->tm_hour, t->tm_min, t->tm_sec);
       The 19%02d needs to be changed to %04d and t->tm_year needs to be
       changed to t->tm_year + 1900:
                reply(213,
                        "%04d%02d%02d%02d%02d%02d",
                        t->tm_year + 1900, t->tm_mon+1, t->tm_mday,
                        t->tm_hour, t->tm_min, t->tm_sec);
       Oh, and wu-ftpd versions that old also have gaping security holes.
    9. The ftpaccess file
         1. Some files (banners, etc) don't get shown to anonymous users.
            When the anonymous user is logged in, bannerfiles are opened
            relative to the root of the anonymous user. Keep this in
            mind. It can be usefull to have 2 sets of banners or use
            links.
         2. What is the exact format of the <times> parameter in the
            "limit"
            This is a format consisting of day and time parameters.
            Possible items : Sa,Su,Mo, .. Any (for any day) and time
            parameters. For example : SaSu|Any1800-0700 means all of
            Saturday and Sunday or Any day between 18:00 and 07:00. Check
            if ftpd inherits the correct time zone.
         3. What tools are there to check the configuration
            ftpcheck found at <URL:ftp://ftp.cle.ab.com/pub/ftpcheck.v2.3
         4. Why does %M produce (Max unlimited) on the login banner
            All counts and maximums depend on which class the user is in,
            and the class is unknown before login (since wu-ftpd takes
            realuser/anonymous/guestuser as a variable for calculating
            which class a user is in).
   10. Programs (ls, gzip, tar) work for real users, not for anonymous
       users, giving errors like 425 Can't create data socket
       (0.0.0.0,20): Bad file number or simply no output.
       First, consider if you can't relink them staticly so the shared
       libraries aren't needed. You can get the GNU fileutils from :
       <URL:ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/fileutils-3.16.tar.gz>
       (version numbers may vary).
       For different operating systems, different libraries and/or
       devices are needed. You can test if things are running correctly
       by doing a chroot to the ftp homedir. To test if /bin/ls is
       working in the ~ftp dir, type :
       chroot ~ftp /bin/ls
       Or, the partition is mounted -nosuid which gives the same error
       under SunOS or Solaris, more information on the page
       <URL:http://www.stokely.com/stokely/sunservice.tips/11991.html>
         1. Solaris
            First, have a look at the manpage for the original
            in.ftpd(1m). It has a scipt for setting everything up. If the
            filesystem with ~ftp is mounted -nosuid, the special device
            files will not work.
            Solaris needs ~ftp/dev/tcp and ~ftp/dev/zero and the
            libraries. Check the man-page for your Solaris version for
            exact details. Use the command ldd to find out which
            libraries a program uses. Also, the ~ftp/etc/group file is
            needed for ls to work, without it it will just dump core.
            Follow the same rules as for /etc/passwd : not too much
            information in that file, like group passwords (if you have
            those).
            Needed libraries can include :
            ld.so, ld.so.1, libc.so.1, libdl.so.1, libintl.so.1,
            libmp.so.1, libnsl.so.1, libsocket.so.1, libw.so.1,
            nss_compat.so.1, nss_dns.so.1, nss_files.so.1, nss_nis.so.1,
            nss_nisplus.so.1, straddr.so
            Problem with /etc/group found by Eric (ewedaa@kset.com).
         2. Building a statically linked ls for Solaris fails
            This is discussed in the comp.unix.solaris Frequently Asked
            Questions <URL:http://www.fwi.uva.nl/pub/solaris/solaris2>
            item 6.24 (at this moment).
         3. Linux
            Use the command ldd to find out which libraries a program
            uses. Also, with ELF binaries you need the ELF file loader,
            ld-linux.so in ~ftp/lib.
            ELF change remarked by Al Longyear (longyear@sii.com).
         4. Dec OSF
            Copy the static version of ls (/sbin/ls) and not the dynamic
            one. The static version is about 400K.
            Make passwd and group files in ~ftp/etc. Copy from /etc/sia
            dir to ~ftp/etc/sia the files matrixconf and siainitgood.
         5. SunOS4.1.x
            SunOS needs ~ftp/dev/zero, ~ftp/dev/tcp and the libraries.
            Check permissions on the device files.
         6. AIX
            AIX comes with scripts to automate this installation.
            AIX 3.2.5 - /usr/lpp/tcpip/samples/anon.ftp
            AIX 4.1.4 - /usr/samples/tcpip/anon.ftp
            After it's done, change the mode of ~ftp/pub to something
            safer.
            Also, AIX comes with a 'dump' utility that can show which
            libraries a program uses.
            Noted by Eilon Gishri (eilon@aristo.tau.ac.il)
         7. IRIX (5.3, 6.2)
            IRIX 6.2 needs ~/ftp/dev/zero and libraries. To create
            /dev/zero, check it's current major and minor number with :
ls -lL /dev/zero
            And then create it in ~ftp using :
cd ~ftp/dev
mknod zero c <major> <minor>
cd ..
chmod 555 dev
            You will probably need to copy /lib/libc.so.1 to
            ~ftp/lib/libc.so.1 and /lib/rld to ~ftp/lib/rld. These are
            required by ls, compress, gtar and gzip.
            You can see what libraries a program needs by doing the
            following:
csh# setenv _RLD_PATH /usr/lib/rld.debug
csh# setenv _RLD_ARGS '-v -quickstart_info -stat'
            To stop seeing what libraries are needed unset the
            environment variables:
csh# unsetenv _RLD_PATH
csh# unsetenv _RLD_ARGS
            Useful information on Irix also in the IRIX Insight Library
            (Online Books) in the book/chapter "IRIX Admin: Networking
            and Mail" in the paragraph "How to Set Up a Proper Anonymous
            FTP Account". Information from Frans Stekelenburg
            (gjs@knmi.nl) and Jim Davis (jdavis@cs.arizona.edu)
         8. SCO Unix
            SCO needs /dev/socksys.
         9. BSD vs SVR4 ls
            This is a very sneaky one. To quote : The problem was that
            ls_short and ls_long were being defined incorrectly (since
            the system was compiled with a BSDish compiler, the BSD
            config file was used) using ls -lA and ls -lgA respectively.
            It turns out that the ls command was running but it was
            erroring out (this is because the system is actually running
            SVR4), since a failed ls produces output only to stderr not
            stdout I saw nothing for my output.
            Information from Perry A. Stupp (pstupp@i-com.com)
        10. It worked, until I upgraded the operating system.
            Something in the upgrade changed in your OS. Most likely :
            newer shared libraries. Also : other major/minor numbers in
            /dev. Redo the shared libs and devices after an upgrade if
            things like the above happen.
   11. Running wu-ftpd
       There is a nice set of manpages with wu-ftpd. They do contain a
       lot of information.
       Also, note that a lot of things about the chrooted environment for
       anonymous users also applies to the chrooted environment for guest
       users.
         1. ftpd allways says "221 Server shutting down. Goodbye."
            The directive shutdown in the ftpaccess file points to a file
            that exists at that moment. Either change the directive or
            delete the file.
            Also, after you've used the ftpshut command, you'll need to
            remove the ftpshut file by hand.
         2. Anonymous ftp works fine, but real users are denied access
            Check the following :
               o Reasons for denial are logged using syslog. Check your
                 logs.
               o Their shell is in the /etc/shells file. Note : AIX
                 doesn't even have this file, so you need to create it
                 for wu-ftpd.
               o The problem has been fixed in the latest versions for
                 AIX. Get the latest version.
               o /etc/shells needs the correct access rights (world
                 readable and not world writable).
               o If you're using shadow passwords : make sure the daemon
                 is compiled with shadow password support.
         3. ftpconversions doesn't work
            There are a lot of possible reasons, mostly having to do with
            the fact that some versions tar use different command line
            parameters.
               o Solaris 2.4 : if you use Solaris tar, and give the
                 commandline as /bin/tar -cf - %s, the effect will be the
                 same as /bin/tar -cvf - %s. The -v option will add
                 extraneous data to the stream. Solution : replace it
                 with /bin/tar cf - %s (no leading -).
               o Also, check your 'tar' and 'compress' directives in
                 ftpaccess.
         4. On-the-fly compression works, on-the-fly tarring, but not
            both.
            With Solaris 2.4 and GNU's tar-1.11.8 (configured and
            compiled with --disable-nls flag) use the GNU tar flag
            --use-compress-program=path to compression program
            sample :
            : : :.tar.Z:/bin/ftp-exec/tar -c
            --use-compress-program=/bin/ftp-exec/compress -f -
            %s:T_REG|T_DIR:O_COMPRESS|O_TAR:TAR+COMPRESS
            : : :.tar.gz:/bin/ftp-exec/tar -c
            --use-compress-program=/bin/ftp-exec/gzip -f -
            %s:T_REG|T_DIR:O_COMPRESS|O_TAR:TAR+GZIP
         5. I want to use zip compression (InfoZip)
            Lines for ftpconversions :
 :.zip: : :/bin/unzip  -qq -p %s:T_REG|T_ASCII:O_UNCOMPRESS:UNZIP
 : : :.zip:/bin/zip -qq -r - %s:T_REG|T_DIR:O_COMPRESS|O_TAR:ZIP
            Info-ZIP can be found at
            <URL:http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/Info-ZIP/>
         6. I want a real user to be able to access the host only via
            ftp, not via telnet
            Create a shell for this purpose (for example, a program that
            says the above or a copy of /bin/true). Put this shell in
            /etc/shells. Change the shell of the user to that shell.
            Next : make sure mail cannot be delivered locally to the
            account. Using the fact that the shell is valid for sendmail
            (it is in /etc/shells) a user can be able to start commands
            as that user.
            Information and a sample script on
            <URL:http://www.landfield.com/wu-ftpd/ftponly/ftponly.html>
            
              The same, for AIX.
                      Use chuser (or SMIT) to set the user to login=no,
                      su=no, telnet=no, rlogin=no.
                      
         7. Somebody uploaded a file with a weird name
            Somebody is trying to misuse your ftp-site for transferring
            software (worst case scenario). Check if the directive
            path-filter in the ftpaccess file is something like :
path-filter anonymous /etc/paths.msg ^[-A-Za-z0-9\._]*$ ^\. ^-
         8. I want anonymous users to be able to upload files, but in the
            most secure manner possible
            In general: you don't want this. But, if you're stubborn...
            Read the upload.configuration.HOWTO, pointer at the beginning
            of this faq. Make very sure that you have the latest version
            of wu-ftpd (2.6.1), set your path-filter to the one mentioned
            above. Make the incoming directory owned by something else
            then ftp (root, or nobody) with another group then ftp
            (nobody). Something like :
drwx-wx-wt       root    nobody        incoming
            This will allow ftp to write in the directory, but not read
            it. Set the upload directive in ftpaccess to something like :
upload    /home/ftp    /home/ftp/incoming/*   yes root daemon 0400 nodirs
            One note : files get created as root and changed to the owner
            mentioned in the upload line. This will fail on some secure
            NFS setups. Best solution is to mount the /incoming
            separately.
         9. The upload clause doesn't work with directories as it used
            to.
            Unlimited subdirectory creation has been prohibited as this
            has been the source of problems with wu-ftpd. You will need
            to explicitely allow a certain amount of levels of subdirs,
            like for example:
upload /home/test /home/test/public_html                   yes test users 0664
dirs 0775
upload /home/test /home/test/public_html/*                 yes test users 0664
dirs 0775
upload /home/test /home/test/public_html/*/*               yes test users 0664
dirs 0775
upload /home/test /home/test/public_html/*/*/*             yes test users 0664
dirs 0775
            This is new for versions 2.6.0 and higher.
        10. The default umask used when a real user uploads a file is
            wrong
            The default umask is inherited from inetd. This can be a
            wrong one. There is a command line parameter -u. Edit the
            line in inetd.conf to something like ftpd -A -L -l -u077.
        11. I heard something about 'SITE EXEC' having a security hole
            In some slackware distributions the _PATH_EXECPATH is set to
            something like /bin. Recompile wu-ftpd with it set to a
            special path like /bin/ftp-exec.
            To test for this hole, type (when logged in as a real user,
            not anonymous) :
            ftp> SITE EXEC bash -c id
            If you get a return with '200-uid=0(root) gid=0(root)' in it,
            you have the problem.
        12. How do I make reports more readable ?
            There are a couple of scripts to make better reports from the
            xferlog.
               o dumpxfer processes the xferlog and gives more humanly
                 readable output
               o processlog script to run dumpxfer, email you the output
                 and truncate the log
            These are available via anonymous ftp via
            <URL:ftp://tnt.microimages.com/tools/> both need Perl.
            I (Koos van den Hout) also wrote a Perl script to process the
            log, mail daily statistics and uploaded files, and create a
            top most downloaded files. It is available from
            <URL:ftp://ftp.cetis.hvu.nl/pub/koos/ftplogcheck>
            iistat generates nice transfer graphs from the xferlog file
            (and from a lot of other sources). Available from
            <URL:ftp://ftp.support.lotus.com/pub/utils/InternetServices/
            iisstat/iisstat.html>
            Phil Schwan wrote xferstats, available from
            ftp://ftp.wu-ftpd.org/pub/support/
            Webalizer, a very good web log analyzer, also supports
            wu-ftpd xferlog format. Available from
            <URL:http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/>
        13. Incoming file transfers fail with SunOS and an NFS mounted
            incoming
            You get errors like :
Dec 7 11:14:33 ftphost vmunix: NFS write error 13 on host fileserver
fh 746 1 a0000 5fea7 3b5a1bd8 a0000 2 1e0a6aed
            That's a known problem. Updating to the latest version is the
            first help. Other possible solutions :
               o Have the incoming disk on the ftpserver itself
               o /etc/ftpaccess sets owner to ftp, group to a restricted
                 group and mode to 0040 (only group read)
            Thanks to Peter Glassenbury (pete@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz) for
            this one.
        14. Normal ftp clients work, Netscape ftp's fail. So, passive
            mode doesn't work.
            Apparantly ftpd needs write permission on ~ftp/dev/tcp in
            order to operate correctly in passive mode (Solaris). Set it
            to the same mode as permissions shown by ls -lL /dev/tcp,
            being 666. Also read the Solaris man page for ftpd for
            Solaris-specific information. Changed from previous versions
            Fix:
cd ~ftp/dev
chmod 666 tcp
            Thanks to Simon Rakov (Simon_Rakov@iongate.staff.ichange.com)
            for this one.
        15. I made a symbolic link within the anonymous tree and it
            doesn't work for the anonymous users.
            Symbolic links are relative to your active root. If you want
            to access files/directories/diskspace outside your chrooted
            environment, you'll have to import it using directory
            loopback mounts (available on at least Solaris) or using NFS
            mounts (available on most other operating systems but they
            have a performance impact).
        16. I want to redirect anonymous users to another machine
            That's a not-so-well-known ftpaccess feature : just add
            'guestserver anon.ftp.server.hostname' to your ftpaccess
            file..
        17. ftpd stops accepting connections when a lot of connections
            come in.
            This is a feature of inetd, not ftpd. Inetd will limit the
            amount of connections that can be made to a service per
            minute. Some versions allow to specify this amount in
            inetd.conf, by specifying it in the nowait flag, like :
ftp stream tcp nowait.256 root /usr/sbin/ftpd ftpd -a
            which will allow 256 connections per minute. Check the
            manpage for inetd.
        18. Running wu-ftpd on a *large* site
            Wu-ftpd is now default suited for running on a large site.
            The patches mentioned below have been included per default.
            For example sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk has made some modifications
            available at
            <URL:ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/mirror/experimental
            /wu-2.4.2-upd13.shar>
            From the notes on those patches:
DAEMON
If ftpd called with -D then run as a standalone daemon listing on the
ftp port.   This can speed up ftpd response as all ftpd then needs to
do is fork off a copy to handle an incoming request.  Under inetd
a new copy has to be opened and exec'd.

FILEWHAT
If SETPROCTITLE doesn't work or if you have so many users that ps
takes a long time then FILEWHAT keeps the info in a file so that
ftpcount can just print it.
        19. Only the first 8 characters of the anonymous username are
            recieved by the server.
            This is actually a bug in very old ftp-clients which only
            send the first 8 characters because the password is limited
            to 8 characters anyway. Upgrade your client.
        20. wu-ftpd fails with '500 Illegal PORT Command' under AIX 4.3
            or Solaris 8
            Both set services in inetd.conf to ipv6 which wu-ftpd doesn't
            support yet. Fix: change the protocol from tcp6 to tcp.
        21. I want to host multiple ftp servers on the same machine
            At this moment this is only possible with one IP number for
            each ftp server. So called 'name based virtual hosting' is
            inherently impossible with the current FTP protocol. wu-ftpd
            2.6.0 supports this in a somewhat limited extent, BeroFTPD
            supports it somewhat better, but read the catch:
            There is a draft for an extension to the ftp protocol named
            HOST to support virtual hosts like HTTP. But, this is a draft
            and there are a lot of old ftp clients out there. So do not
            count on using this.
        22. I just upgraded and now nobody can log in. It worked before.
            Did you look in the system log? The daemon will log the
            reason for the failure there. It helps a lot to know why.
            Most plausible (at the moment) you're upgrading to the latest
            version and, if you'd look, the syslog says 'not in any
            class'. That means you're using the old, unsafe wildcards on
            your class statements such as the following: class lcl
            real,guest,anonymous 127.*.*.* The latest versions don't
            support this notation for security reasons. Use netmask or
            CIDR instead, as in either of the following: class lcl
            real,guest,anonymous 127.0.0.0/8 or class lcl
            real,guest,anonymous 127.0.0.0:255.0.0.0.
        23. I get disconnected directly from the ftp server.
            Most probable reason: in inetd.conf the ftp server gets
            started using tcpd (tcp_wrappers) which fails a security
            check. Look in the logfiles given from syslog.conf which
            check fails.
        24. Mirror breaks with wu-ftpd 2.6.0.
            Get the patch for mirror to update it. Available from:
            <URL:ftp://ftp.wu-ftpd.org/pub/support/wu-ftpd-2.6.0-mirror-
            2.9.patch>
            In wu-ftpd 2.6.0, some flaws in dealing with the ftp protocol
            were fixed which broke some clients.
        25. Logins to the ftp server take a long time, after that things
            run smooth
            Possible causes: IDENT (RFC931) lookup is enabled in wu-ftpd.
            This has a timeout of 10 seconds. If the protocol (port 113)
            gets blocked by a firewall or suchlike, it will wait for
            timeout. Or, DNS lookups take a long time because of broken
            dns.
        26. ls doesn't show anything except files. It does not show
            directories and links
            Some ftp clients improperly use the NLST and LIST commands.
            NLST was intended to show files only for retrieval using the
            mget command. LIST was intended to show everything in
            human-readable form. Earlier versions of the wu-ftpd did not
            correctly interpret the RFC which defines these commands and
            many ftp clients were written incorrectly and do not use the
            definitions in the RFC. Starting wu-ftpd 2.6.0, the
            interpretation of NLST versus LIST ftp commands has been
            changed to what is the right interpretation. NLST lists
            retrievable files for the ftp mget command, LIST lists all
            files for a human reader. Suggested fix: fix the client
            software, or train the users to use ls -l (or dir) in a
            command-line client to get a listing of the files and
            directories.
        27. My client hangs at the end of a transfer
            Starting wu-ftpd 2.6.0, the FTP RFC has been implemented in a
            stricter way, which breaks some clients. Most visible clients
            are mirror and squid. More information on which clients and
            how to update them at
            <URL:http://www.wu-ftpd.org/broken-clients.html>
        28. Sometimes ftpd stops working and inetd logs 'ftp/tcp server
            failing (looping), service terminated'
            Inetd counts the number of connection occuring within a
            minute. If that number exceeds some threshold, is assumes the
            ftp service is broken (or under attack) and keeps getting
            restarted - and shuts down the service. In most systems, this
            can be overcome by adding a parameter to the inetd.conf file
            like .... nowait.400 (400 connections per minute). Check the
            specific syntax for your Operating system.
        29. I can't login, in the syslog is: get passwd; pwdb: request
            not recognized
            Your /etc/pam.d/ftp file is missing/incomplete, it should
            contain at least:
#%PAM-1.0
auth    required pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok
auth    required pam_shells.so
account required pam_pwdb.so
session required pam_pwdb.so
            And for denying users in /etc/ftpusers:
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_listfile.so item=user sense=deny file
=/etc/ftpusers onerr=succeed
   12. Other things
         1. Where is the FTP protocol documented ?
            RFC959 documents the FTP protocol.
         2. How can I make my ftp-archive accessible by Email (ftpmail) ?
            There is a Perl-script collection available named ftpmail. It
            is available on a lot of ftp-sites (archie for 'ftpmail'),
            some of which are :
            <URL:ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/ftpmail/>,
            nic.funet.fi, ftp.warwick.ac.uk, ftp.loria.fr,
            ftp.germany.eu.net.

       (No chocolate cookies. Yet)
         1. How do I contact the WU-FTPD Development team
            Send email to (wuftpd-members@wu-ftpd.org)
         2. I have a correction / new feature, how do I submit it for the
            WU-FTPD Development team's consideration
            The development team prefers context-diffs against the
            lastest version of the source code. Completely new files may
            be included separately or as part of the context-diff.
            If your entire patch is small (less than 25,000 bytes) you
            may send it via email, with a brief description of your
            change, to wuftpd-members@wu-ftpd.org.
            If your patch or addition is large (over 25,000 bytes) or
            invloves several files, please create a compressed tar
            (tar.gz or tar.Z) and upload it to
            ftp://ftp.wu-ftpd.org/incoming After you have uploaded,
            please send a brief description of your patchs, along with
            the name you uploaded it as, to wuftpd-members@wu-ftpd.org.
         3. I have what I believe to be a critical security problem with
            the daemon and don't want to talk about it via email. Can I
            call someone on the telephone
            Yes, but you had better be right. Be sure you have read all
            of this FAQ, and all of the documentation which came with the
            daemon. If you believe you have a problem which effects the
            security of servers, other than your own, you may contact
            Gregory A Lundberg at
        1-800-809-2195 or 1-937-298-5254 (office)
        1-888-977-5370 or 1-937-299-7653 (home)
                          1-937-299-8743 (FAX)
