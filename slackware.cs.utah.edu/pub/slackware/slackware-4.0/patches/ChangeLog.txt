(These packages should work on any libc5-based Slackware system)
bind.tgz:  (urgency: high)  (* SECURITY FIX *)
   Upgraded to bind-8.2.2-P5.  This fixes a vulnerability in the processing of
   NXT records that can be used in a DoS attack or (theoretically) be exploited
   to gain access to the server.  It is suggested that everyone running bind
   upgrade to this package as soon as possible.
nfs-server.tgz:  (urgency: high)  (* SECURITY FIX *)
   Upgraded to nfs-server-2.2beta47, to fix a security problem found in
   nfs-server-2.2beta46 and earlier.  By using a long pathname on a directory
   NFS mounted read-write, it may be possible for an attacker to execute
   arbitrary code on the server.  It is recommended that everyone running an
   NFS server upgrade to this package immediately.
pine.tgz  (urgency: high): This updates Pine to version 4.21.  Pine versions
   earlier than 4.0 have a Y2K bug where the date sorting will not work
   properly when the new century begins.
imapd.tgz  (urgency: low):  This updates imapd to the version from Pine 4.21.
sysklogd.tgz (urgency: high):  It's possible to hang a machine and cause a
   denial of service by opening many connections to the syslogd shipped with
   Slackware 4.0 and earlier.  This package upgrades to sysklogd-1.3-33,
   which fixes the problem.
wuftpd.tgz:  (urgency:  low)
   Relinked against -lshadow, enabling MD5 shadow password support.
