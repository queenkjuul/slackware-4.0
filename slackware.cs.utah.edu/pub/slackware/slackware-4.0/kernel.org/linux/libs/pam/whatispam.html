Linux-PAM is a free implementation of the following <a

from Sunsoft.

Q1: What exactly is PAM?
<br>
A1: PAM = Pluggable Authentication Modules

<p>
Basically, it is a flexible mechanism for authenticating users.

<p>
Since the beginnings of UNIX, authenticating a user has been accomplished
via the user entering a password and the system checking if the entered
password corresponds to the encrypted official password that is stored
in /etc/passwd . The idea being that the user *is* really that user if
and only if they can correctly enter their secret password.

<p>
That was in the beginning. Since then, a number of new ways of
authenticating users have become popular. Including more complicated
replacements for the /etc/passwd file, and hardware devices Smart cards
etc..

<p>
The problem is that each time a new authentication scheme is developed, it
requires all the necessary programs (login, ftpd etc...) to be rewritten to
support it.

<p>
PAM provides a way to develop programs that are independent of
authentication scheme. These programs need "authentication modules" to be
attatched to them at run-time in order to work. Which authentication module
is to be attatched is dependent upon the local system setup and is at the
discretion of the local system administrator.
