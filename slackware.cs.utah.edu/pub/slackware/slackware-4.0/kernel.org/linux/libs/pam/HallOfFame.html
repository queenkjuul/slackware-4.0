<H2>The Challenge</H2>

<P>
This is a page devoted to the adoration of people who have broken PAM. Would
you like to have your name on this page?  You have the <a

<H2>People that deserve your respect</H2>

<p>
The folowing people have found weaknesses in the Linux-PAM distribution. 
Thanks to their efforts Linux-PAM is a more secure package. Where available,
we have indicated the fix that resulted from their investigations.

<H4>Holes in libpam</H4>

<p>Werner Almesberger pointed out that advisory locking can lead to an
pretty effective denail of service attack.  Advisory locking was removed
from Linux-PAM-0.52.

<H4>Holes in modules</H4>

<p>Subtle security hole in pam_rhosts module found by Jacob Langford
(Tue, 30 Sep 1997 11:03:05 -0500) and fix posted by Andrey
V. Savochkin (Wed, 1 Oct 1997 11:49:04 +0300).  The problem was
concerned with successive calls to gethostbyname() and a failure to
cache the results of previous calls.

<p>Olaf Kirch took the time to scour the source for Linux-PAM 0.58.
He uncovered a few subtle problems with a number of modules.  All of
these problems (besides one relating to IPv6) were fixed in the 0.63
release.  [This was the next release (three days) after Olaf's
posting.]

<p>Michal Zalewski identified a permission manipulation problem with
the pam_unix module (Dec 23, 1998 at 01:12:45PM +0100). Andrey
V. Savochkin provided a patch (Thu, 24 Dec 1998 18:02:03 +0300) for
this and a similar problem in pam_tally.
