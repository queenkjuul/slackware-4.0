<em>Service Monitoring Daemon</em>

<hr>

<h2>What is "mon"?</h2>
<em>mon</em> is a general-purpose resource monitoring
system, which can be used to monitor network service availability, server
problems, environmental conditions such as the temperature
in a room, or any number of things.
<p>

Resource monitoring can be viewed as two separate tasks: the testing
of a condition, and triggering some sort of action upon failure.
<em>mon</em> was designed to keep the testing and action-taking tasks
separate, as stand-alone programs. <em>mon</em> is
implemented as a scheduler which executes the the monitors (which test a
condition), and calls the appropriate alerts if the monitor fails.
<p>

Monitors and alerts are not a part of <em>mon</em>, even though the distribution
comes with a handful of them to get you started. This means that if a
new service needs monitoring, or if a new alert is required, the <em>mon</em>
server does not need to be changed. This makes <em>mon</em> easily
extensible.
<p>

<em>mon</em> currently monitors over two hundred hosts at our site, using the
monitor scripts which are supplied with the distribution.
