<i>Spamcan</i> is a simple yet extremely effective and powerful junkmail
capturing/nuking sofware patch to Sendmail v8.  It is designed to
capture site-wide junkmail to a global capture file, a user owned spam
mailbox if it exists, or to /dev/null.

<P>

While user-level filtering programs such as procmail may be used to
filter out spam by regular expression, Spamcan is the first of it's
kind designed to capture spam site-wide by regular expression.  In my
experience, bouncing spam is futile and wasts bandwidth.  Most spam
has forged addresses and invalid return addresses.

<p>

<i>Spamcan</i> was written with the philosophy that unsolicited email is an
evil and disruptive presence.  In my opinion it is unreasonable to
ask or require each and every user at a site with hundreds of users to
put up with unsolicited email or to manage their own anti-spam rules.
I beleve it is up to the system administration group to provide
excellent service to the user community and I belive Spamcan is a
powerful tool that aids in providing excellent service.

<i>Spamcan</i> works by attempting to match every header line of a
mail message, including subject line, with a set of regular
expressions you've prepared.  By default matching is not case
sensitive.  The expression list typically contains lines such as the
following:

<pre>
x-advertisement
sexyhot
(^Subject: (.*(free|mak(e|ing)).*money))
fresh.*addresses
mega-mailer
ExtractorPro
((stealth|mass).*mailer)
make.*money.*fast
(^(From|To): (.*[0-9]{8,}@.*\.[a-z]{3}))
(cyber(market|shop|promo|gold))
((sales|srhot|foryou|allvip|mailman|succeed|success|everyon|megaweb|emailer|allinternetusers|market|4u|Friend)@.*\.[a-z]{3})
((sallynet|scholarship|shoppingplanet|answerme|onlineprofit|yourdomain|ispam|devotion|quantcom|savetrees|nowhere)\.[a-z]{3})
--- CLOAKED! ---
</pre>

The envelope "from" is also examined.  Using regular expressions
is a very powerful and dangerous capability.  Extreme caution must be
taken in formulating your expressions.  Fortunately, Spamcan does not
discard or bounce email.  Rather, Spamcan <i>cans</i> it to a
<i>spamcan</i>.  In the unfortunate event that you've managed to
capture non-spam, it may be forwarded to the appropriate user.
<i>Spamcan</i> adds the header X-Spamcan-Reason to every message it
identifies as spam before sending it to the spamcan.  It contains the
reason for identifying the mail as spam and the intended recipient.

<p>

All spamcan diagnostics are logged via syslog with the mail facility
at the debug level.  Look for any problems relating to spamcan there.

<i>Spamcan</i> was designed to be installed on the internal mailhost
although this is not a requirement.  It likes to look in
/var/spool/mail for two files named <i>username</i>.spam and
.nospamcan.<i>username</i>.  Users at your site may choose not to have
<i>Spamcan</i> scan their mail by touching
/var/spool/mail/.nospamcan.<i>username</i>.  Users at your site may
also choose to have spam directed a personal spam mailbox owned by
them by touching /var/spool/mail/<i>username</i>.spam.  The directory
/var/spool/mail was chosen to be the root for these files because in
many installations it is globablly writable.  Also, it's generally not
a good idea to access user home directories because large mail
distributions may cause your automounter to mount everyone's home.  I
recommend you don't do this with .forward either.

<p>

<i>Spamcan</i> was designed stay out of the way of valid mail message
traffic.  It examines all non-message-id headers.  Internal mail and
outgoing mail is not examined.  Incoming mail messages containing the
in-reply-to header are also passed through un-examined.  If spammers
use this as a back-door this feature may have to be removed.

<p>

Read <tt>INSTALL.SPAMCAN</tt> for detailed installation notes.

Impliment a scoring system.  Assign points to regular expressions in
the configuration file.  Add up the points for a mail message; if this
number reaches some threashold, identify the message as spam.
Otherwise deliver mail with an X-Spamlevel header with the number of
points as the header value.  This way the user community can filter out
possible spam without having to know about formulating anti-spam rules.
For example, a user's ~/.procmailrc could look something like the following. <p>

<pre>

# Recommend users add something like this to the end of their ~/.procmailrc

:0 h
SPAMLEVEL=|formail -xX-Spamlevel:

:0
* ? test $SPAMLEVEL -gt 60
Mail/spamorama

:0
* ? test $SPAMLEVEL -gt 40
Mail/spam

:0
* ? test $SPAMLEVEL -gt 30
Mail/junk

:0
* ? test $SPAMLEVLE -gt 20
Mail/junk_lists

:0
* ? test $SPAMLEVEL -gt 10
Mail/lists
</pre>
<p>

Do some limited sanity checking on header files.  Look for missing <tt>To:</tt>
or <tt>From:</tt> headers.  Check if local domain appears on <tt>To:</tt> or
<tt>Cc:</tt>.  Check if <tt>Reply-to:</tt> or <tt>From:</tt> is the same as <tt>
To:</tt>.  Add points for each of these to <tt>X-Spamlevel</tt>.

Spamcan is known to work on Linux, Solaris, SunOS, Irix and NextStep,
but I'm sure it would not take much to make it work on other platforms.
