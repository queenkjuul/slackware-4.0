ash:      bash-specific syntax.  The Slackware setup scripts are a notable
ash:      exception, since ash is the shell used on the install disks.  NetBSD
ash:      uses ash as its /bin/sh.

xs3v:     ViRGE/VX 8M (4M VRAM/4M DRAM), and with a 220MHz ViRGE/VX card with
xs3v:     2MB VRAM up to 1600x1200 with 8/15/16bpp.  Note that the XF86_SVGA
xs3v:     server also supports these chipsets (and others).  It's recommended to
xs3v:     try using that first.  Installing this package will create a link in
xs3v:     /usr/X11R6/bin from XF86_S3V to X, setting this server as the default.
