Extra Slackware packages / user contributed package directory
_____________________________________________________________

These are some extra packages that might be handy. Use 'pkgtool' to install or
remove these from your system. These can also be installed with 'installpkg'.

Anyone who wants to contribute a package to this directory should send me mail 
at: volkerdi@slackware.com. The package must install cleanly, and must include
a description to be added to this index (in which you can feel free to give 
yourself some credit).  Slackware contains an easy to use package creation
tool called 'makepkg' that can be used to make the package.  To be considered
for inclusion, you must also provide build scripts which build the package
from the original source archive.  These may either be a "SlackBuild" format
script (see the source/ directory for many examples) that builds the final
.tgz package, or a simpler .build script that untars the source, applies any
patches, configures and builds the source, and does a 'make install'.  Again,
there are many examples in the source/ area.

I don't offer any support for these packages.  (well, I might, but I won't
promise anything)

Some of these long package names may cause unsightly wrap-around in the color
pkgtool's package removal menu, but it should still work ok.
