amp:
amp:      amp is a command line MP3 player. It's written by Tomislav Uzelac

amp:      of the current MP3 players out there got their start by using amp
amp:      as a code base.
amp:
amp:      REQUIREMENTS: Well, you'll probably want to have an MP3 file or
amp:      two and also sound support in your kernel (/dev/dsp).  :)

bash-2.03: GNU bash-2.03.
bash-2.03:
bash-2.03: The GNU Bourne-Again SHell.  Bash is a sh-compatible command
bash-2.03: interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or
bash-2.03: from a file.  Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn
bash-2.03: and C shells (ksh and csh).  Bash is ultimately intended to be a
bash-2.03: conformant implementation of the IEEE Posix Shell and Tools
bash-2.03: specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).

diald-0.16.5: diald-0.16.5.
diald-0.16.5:
diald-0.16.5: Diald is a daemon that provides on demand IP links via SLIP or 
diald-0.16.5: PPP.  The purpose of diald is to make it transparently appear that
diald-0.16.5: you have a permanent connection to a remote site.  Diald sets up a
diald-0.16.5: "proxy" device which stands in for the physical connection to a
diald-0.16.5: remote site.  It then monitors the proxy, waiting for packets to
diald-0.16.5: arrive. When interesting packets arrive it will attempt to
diald-0.16.5: establish the physical link to the remote site using either SLIP
diald-0.16.5: or PPP, and if it succeeds it will forward traffic from the proxy
diald-0.16.5: to the physical link.

ircd:     ircd - The Internet Relay Chat Program Server
ircd:     ircd is the server (daemon) program for the Internet Relay
ircd:     Chat Program.  The ircd is a server in that its function
ircd:     is to "serve" the client program irc(1) with messages and
ircd:     commands.  All commands and user messages are passed
ircd:     directly to the ircd for processing and relaying to other
ircd:     ircd sites. The irc(1) program depends upon there being
ircd:     an ircd server running somewhere (either on your local
ircd:     UNIX site or a remote ircd site) so that it will have
ircd:     somewhere to connect to and thus allow the user to begin
ircd:     talking to other users.

icewm:    This is icewm-0.8.9, a window manager for X11.
icewm:    
icewm:    The goal of IceWM is to provide a small, fast and familiar window
icewm:    manager for the X11 window system. Compatibility with the mwm window
icewm:    manager is desired and will be implemented where appropriate.
icewm:    
icewm:    The IceWM is designed to emulate the look of Motif, OS/2 Warp 4, OS/2
icewm:    Warp 3 and Windows 95. Others might added in the future.
icewm:    
icewm:    It also tries to combine the feel of the above systems whenever it is
icewm:    compatible.

noweb-2.8a: Noweb is a literate-programming tool like FunnelWEB or nuweb, only
noweb-2.8a: simpler.  A noweb file contains program source code interleaved with
noweb-2.8a: documentation.  When noweb is invoked, it writes the program source
noweb-2.8a: code to the output files mentioned in the noweb file, and it writes
noweb-2.8a: a TeX file for typeset documentation.  The author recommends using 
noweb-2.8a: LaTeX; noweb comes with an efficient LaTeX->HTML converter, so the
noweb-2.8a: resulting programs can easily be browsed on the World-Wide Web.
noweb-2.8a: More info can be found at URL http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~nr/noweb
noweb-2.8a: and on the USENET news group comp.programming.literate.

emacspeak-9.0:  Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow
emacspeak-9.0:  someone who cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.
emacspeak-9.0:  (Until now, the only option available to visually impaired
emacspeak-9.0:  users has been to use a talking PC as a terminal.)
emacspeak-9.0:  Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs.  Once you start emacs
emacspeak-9.0:  with emacspeak loaded, you get spoken feedback for
emacspeak-9.0:  everything you do.  Your mileage will vary depending on
emacspeak-9.0:  how well you can use Emacs.  There is nothing that you
emacspeak-9.0:  cannot do inside Emacs :-).  This package supports the
emacspeak-9.0:  DECtalk Express and DECtalk MultiVoice speech
emacspeak-9.0:  synthesizers.  For other synthesizers, look for separate
emacspeak-9.0:  driver packages.

afterstep: was originally a continuation of the Bowman window manager (based on 
afterstep: fvwm), but is now its own project. This is a classic version of
afterstep: AfterStep, which offers a single configuration file (.steprc) and
afterstep: NEXTSTEP-like widgets. It's a lean, mean, window managing machine.
