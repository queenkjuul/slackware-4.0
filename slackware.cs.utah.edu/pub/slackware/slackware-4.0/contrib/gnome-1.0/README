This is the second release of gnome packages for 
Slackware Linux 4.0.  These packages were built
on the beta2 release with NLS support (which 
differs from the previous release).  You should
have the following packages installed from the 
Slackware cdrom disk sets.

d1/gettext.tgz (shared libintl for NLS)
xap1/gimp.tgz (glib/gtk 1.2.2)
xap1/libgr.tgz (necessary graphics libs)

Use pkgtool or installpkg to install these packages,
and add the following to your xinitrc

exec /usr/bin/gnome-session

These packages were built with egcs-1.1.2.
The libraries contained in these packages were 
stripped of debugging symbols to decrease size. The
binaries were stripped of all symbols for the 
same reason.  These packages are still larger 
than the RPM version because they contain everything
and are not broken up into smaller packages (base, devel,
etc..)

Many thanks go to:

Patrick J. Volkerding for creating one of the best
distributions of Linux out there.

Miguel de Icaza and the entire Gnome team for the 
great software they've brought to linux.

All the people who've submitted reports about how
these packages work for them.  I still appreciate
any comments especially from those who have gotten
them to work on older versions (3.6).
