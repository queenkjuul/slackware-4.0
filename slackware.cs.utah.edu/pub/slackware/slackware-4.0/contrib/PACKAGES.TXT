PACKAGE NAME:  diald-0.16.5.tgz
PACKAGE LOCATION:  ./contrib
PACKAGE SIZE (compressed):  117 K
PACKAGE SIZE (uncompressed):  290 K
PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
diald-0.16.5: diald-0.16.5.
diald-0.16.5:
diald-0.16.5: Diald is a daemon that provides on demand IP links via SLIP or 
diald-0.16.5: PPP.  The purpose of diald is to make it transparently appear that
diald-0.16.5: you have a permanent connection to a remote site.  Diald sets up a
diald-0.16.5: "proxy" device which stands in for the physical connection to a
diald-0.16.5: remote site.  It then monitors the proxy, waiting for packets to
diald-0.16.5: arrive. When interesting packets arrive it will attempt to
diald-0.16.5: establish the physical link to the remote site using either SLIP
diald-0.16.5: or PPP, and if it succeeds it will forward traffic from the proxy
diald-0.16.5: to the physical link.

emacspeak-9.0:  Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs.  Once you start emacs
emacspeak-9.0:  with emacspeak loaded, you get spoken feedback for
emacspeak-9.0:  everything you do.  Your mileage will vary depending on
emacspeak-9.0:  how well you can use Emacs.  There is nothing that you
emacspeak-9.0:  cannot do inside Emacs :-).  This package supports the
emacspeak-9.0:  DECtalk Express and DECtalk MultiVoice speech
emacspeak-9.0:  synthesizers.  For other synthesizers, look for separate
emacspeak-9.0:  driver packages.
