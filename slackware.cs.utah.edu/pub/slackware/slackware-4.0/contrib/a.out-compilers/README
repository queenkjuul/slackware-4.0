These are compilers for the obsolete Linux a.out binary format.

A bit of history... a.out used to be the main Linux binary format, but was
phased out in favor of ELF (which is better for a lot of reasons) in late 1995.
There are still a few a.out binaries floating around on the net, and for now
Slackware retains a set of a.out shared libaries in the A series for backward
compatability with these binaries, as well as two sets of a.out X shared
libraries (oldlibs5.tgz and oldlibs6.tgz) in Slackware's X series.  But, as of
Slackware 3.5 the compilers for this format are being officially depricated and
will probably not be maintained much after this.  In fact, if you've got a
special need for a.out you might want to let me know, because it's possible
these may eventually disappear altogether unless someone tells me they still
require support for a.out.  (maybe there are some old commerical a.out libraries
still in use that were never released in ELF format?  ...I'm not aware of any,
though)
                
To make a.out binaries, install these packages with 'installpkg', and then use
'gccaout' as your compiler.  For most non-Linux-historians, installing these
packages is probably a waste of drive space.
