(Xgrabsc version 2.41)

INTRO TO xgrabsc

When I first wrote xgrabsc, there were a number of programs available
for getting X-Window screen dumps (e.g., xwd and xwps), but they
were all restricted to dumping a single window in a single format.
I wrote xgrabsc in an effort to get around these restrictions.

The main contribution of this program is its use of root-window
rubberbanding to allow capture of arbitrary portions of the screen,
and its multiple output formats (x-bitmap, portable-bitmap, x-pixmap, xwd,
puzzle, "simple", and several Postscript formats).

The Postscript dumps will use run-length encoding if it results in
any savings in size.  A typical xterm window dump on a mono system
runs around 40K bytes (20K for binary output).  An xwd dump on the
same screen will be around 650K bytes.  While the xpr program has a
"compress" option, it only compresses white samples.  Reducing the 
size of the output increases the cost of computing the dump and the
final printing of the dump, but it reduces the cost of storage and
the time to transfer the dump to your printer.  The latter is
especially important for large screen dumps.

The xgrabsc program is not interactive.  You specify all processing
options on the command line with obscure option characters.  These
are all detailed in the man page.  An interactive interface to xgrabsc,
named xgrab, is also included in this release.  xgrab allows you to
do most of the setup with a mouse, and then uses the xgrabsc program
to actually do the processing.  To use xgrab you must have the xgrabsc
program in your execution path.



OPTIONS FOR BUILDING xgrabsc

The file config.h contains all the configuration options for xgrabsc.
Please take a moment to look through that file before building xgrabsc.

You also have the choice of building either the Athena or Motif version of
the xgrab form.  The default is to build the Athena version since many people
don't have Motif yet.  If you have some version of OSF's Motif include and
library files and you want to build the Motif version of the xgrab form,
you will have to edit the Imakefile or simple.mak before building.

For VMS there are MMS files for building xgrabsc that were contributed by
a user.  There are no files for building the windowed xgrab interface as
yet.  If you come up with some, please send them to me.

BUILDING xgrabsc

Xgrabsc should build easily enough.  If you don't have the imake
program, use simple.mak (i.e., make -f simple.mak).  There are targets
for xgrabsc, xgrab, install, install.man, and clean.

If you use simple.mak you will have to edit the file to put in the installed
locations of various files.

E.g.,
  xmkmf
  make
  make install
  make install.man

The install target will put xgrabsc in /usr/bin/X11 and the man page in
/usr/man/man1, unless you are using imake and your configuration files
specify alternative directories.  If you are using simple.mak and don't
like these locations, change the makefile before installing.

Please send comments, bugs, and enhancements to bruce@slc.com.  Please
read the Bugs file before sending bug reports.
