To install packages in this directory (*), use the Slackware package tools.
Packages may be installed from the command line using the "installpkg" command:

# installpkg somepackage.tgz

   * there are a few exceptions to this -- if the file ends in .tgz, it's
     a package that's ready to install with 'installpkg'.  If, on the other
     hand, the file ends in .tar.gz, then it's probably an archive which should
     be extracted into a temporary directory with 'tar xzvf package.tar.gz'.
     Don't try to use installpkg or pkgtool to install .tar.gz files.

NOTE:  Some packages should only be installed in single-user mode.  This is
especially true of packages that contain daemons, like the networking package
tcpip.tgz, or the print spooler package bsdlpr.tgz.  To switch to single user
mode, use this command:

# telinit 1

To switch back to the normal runlevel after installing your new package(s),
use this command:

# telinit 3

Packages may also be installed using the menu-based package installation and
removal tool "pkgtool".  Run pkgtool in the directory with the packages and
follow the on screen prompts.

Removing packages
-----------------

The Slackware package management tools provide a way to remove installed 
packages easily and safely.  (well, obviously if you remove the wrong package
it can be harmful to your machine's health :^)

To remove a package, switch into the directory containing the package database:

# cd /var/log/packages

In this directory, you'll find a text file for each package.  You can look at
the files with "less" to see information about what each package does and 
which files it contains.  If you want to remove a package, use the "removepkg"
command in the package database directory:

# removepkg somepackage

You'll see quite a bit of output on the screen telling you exactly which files
and directories are removed, which you may wish to redirect to a file for later
inspection.
