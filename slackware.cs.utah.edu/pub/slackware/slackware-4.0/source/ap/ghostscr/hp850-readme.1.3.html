CREDITS: Much of the driver is based on ideas derived
            from the cdj550 driver of George Cameron.
	<p>    
	    The support for the hp670, hp690, hp890
	    and hp1600 was added by Martin Gerbershagen.

<pre>   11.11.96. Initial release of the driver 

   25.08.97  Version 1.2. Resolved all but one of the 
                          known bugs, introduced a couple
			  of perfomance improvements. Complete
			  new color-transfer-function handling.
			  (see gamma).

  01.06.98   Version 1.3  Due to the most welcome contribution
                          of Martin Gerbershagen (ger@ulm.temic.de),
                          support for the hp670, hp690 and hp890
			  and hp1600 has been added. Martin has also
			  resolved all known bugs.

	     Problems  :  Dark colors are still pale.
	                  
</pre>

  The diver needs no longer special switches to be invoked
  except -sDEVICE=cdj850, or -sDEVICE=CDJ890, or sDEVICE=CDJ670
  or -sDevice=CDJ1600

<p>

  The hp690 is supported through the hp670 device, the hp855, hp870 
  and the hp1100 through the hp850 device.
<p>

  The driver implements the following switches:

<pre>
   -dPapertype= 0  plain paper [default]
                1  bond paper
		2  special paper
		3  glossy film
		4  transparency film

		Note, currently the lookuptables are not suited
		for printing on special paper or transperencies.
		Please revert to the gamma functions in this case.

   -dQuality=  -1 draft     
                0 normal       [default]
                1 presentation 

   -dRetStatus= 0 C-RET off
                1 C-RET on [default]

   -dMasterGamma= 3.0 [default = 1.0]
    __Note__: To take advantage of the calibrated color-transfer
              functions, be sure not to have any Gamma-Statements
	      left! If you need to (i.e. overhead sheets), 
	      you still can use the gamma-functions, but they will 
	      override the built-in calibration. To use gamma in the 
	      traditional way, set MasterGamma to any value greater
	      1.0 and less 10.0. To adjust individual gamma-values,
	      you have to additionally set MasterGamma to a value
	      greater 1.0 and less 10.0
	      
</pre>

   When using the driver, be aware that printing in 600dpi involves
   processing of large amounts of data (> 188MB !). Therefore, the
   driver is not what you would expect to be a fast driver ;-)
   This is no problem when printing a full sized color page (because
   printing itself is slow), but it's really annoying if yoy print only
   text pages. Maybe I can optimize the code for text-only pages in a
   later release. Right now, it is recommended to use the highest
   possible optimisation level your compiler offers....
   For the time beeing, use the cdj550 device with -sBitsPerPixel=3
   for fast proof-prints. If you simply want to print 600dpi b/w data,
   use the cdj550 device with -sBitsPerPixel=8 (or 1).
   
<p>
   Since the printer itself is slow, it may help to set the
   process-priority of the gs-process to regular or even less. On a
   486/100MHZ this is still sufficient to maintain a continuos
   data-flow.
   Note to OS/2 users: Simply put the gs-window into the background,
   or minimize it. Also make sure, that print01.sys is invoked without
   the /irq switch (great speed improvement under warp4).

<p>
   The printer default settings compensate for dot-gain by a
   calibrated color-transfer function. If this appears to be to light
   for your business-graphs, or for overhead-sheets, feel free to set
   -dMasterGamma=1.7.
<p>

   Furthermore, you may tweak the gammavalues independently by setting
   -dGammaValC, -dGammaValM, -dGammaValY or -dGammaValK (if not set,
   the values default to MasterGamma). This will only work, when
   -dMasterGamma is set to a value greater than 1.0.

<p>

<p>
   Note: Depending on how you transfered the files, 
   you might need to remove some CR-codes used on intel-based machines:
 simply type: <code>  unzip -a hp850.zip </code>

   to compile with gs5.x, add 

<code> DEVICE_DEVS4=cdj850.dev cdj670.dev cdj890.dev cdj1600.dev </code>

   to your makefile. 

<p>

   BTW, it is always a good idea to read make.txt found in the
   gs-distrib before attempting to recompile.....
