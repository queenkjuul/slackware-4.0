    This edition, 1.05 of 21 October 1997 only corrects typographical
    errors in the previous editions 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, and 1.04.
    There are no other changes.

    This is an elementary introduction to programming in Emacs Lisp
    for people who are not programmers, and who are not necessarily
    interested in programming, but who do want to customize or extend
    their computing environment.

The gzip'd tar file, `emacs-lisp-intro-1.05.tar.gz' contains the
Texinfo source file for `emacs-lisp-intro.texi'.  You may convert
this Texinfo file to Info to read online or typeset it to print.

The Texinfo source file, `emacs-lisp-intro.texi', formats without
error using TeX version 3.14159 and `texinfo.tex' version 2.196, and
`makeinfo' version 1.67.  The file does not format with some obsolete
versions of `texinfo.tex'.

The tar file also contains ten optional Encapsulated Post Script
figures.  These figures are not necessary, merely nice to look at ---
without them, you get the same figures printed with ASCII characters.
Whether and how you print them depends on your site.

You will find instructions on formatting in the README in the tar file
and at the beginning of the Texinfo file 'emacs-lisp-intro.texi'.

Best Wishes!
