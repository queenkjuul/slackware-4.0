TransFig is a set of tools for creating TeX documents with graphics
which are portable, in the sense that they can be printed in a wide
variety of environments.

TransFig 3.2.1 is available from ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications/drawing_tools/transfig
or from ftp://epb1.lbl.gov/xfig.
Be sure to set binary mode when transferring.

You also need a JPEG library, which can be found in ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries.

The transfig directory contains the source for the transfig command
which generates a Makefile which translates Fig code to various graphics
description languages using the fig2dev program.  In previous releases,
this command was implemented as a shell script.

The fig2dev directory contains a general program for translating from
Fig code to other graphics desciption languages.  The dev subdirectory
contains a library of output drivers used by fig2dev.

Drivers currently exist for the following graphics langauges:
AutoCad slide, BOX, (E)EPIC macros, LaTeX picture environment, PIC, PiCTeX, PNG,
PostScript, Encapsulated Postscript, GIF, IBM-GL, JPEG, PCX, MF (METAFONT),
TeXtyl, TIFF, TPIC, XBM (X11 Bitmap), XPM (X11 Pixmap), and TK (tcl/tk).

Fig2dev can be configured with a subset of these drivers.

I have taken over the maintenance of TransFig from Micah Beck so please send any
bug notices, fixes, contributions etc to me at xfig-bugs@epb1.lbl.gov.

*****************************************************************************
Following is a description of the CHANGES for 3.2.1

NEW FEATURES
	o New driver for tk (tcl/tk) - Generates canvas objects and canvas.
	  from Mike Markowski (mm@udel.edu)
	o -h option to print all options for all output languages
	o Japanese text support for LaTeX output
	  from T. Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)

BUGS FIXED
	o XPMLIB renamed to XPMLIBS in Imakefile because of conflict with
	  XFree86 variable name in xmkmf config files
	o Fixed bug in JPEGINCDIR path when relative path is used (when
	  USEINSTALLEDJPEG is *not* used) - the dev directory is one level
	  deeper so "../" is prepended for that case
	o The rest of the scaling problems for latex fixed :-)
	  from Hans Werner Strube (strube@physik3.gwdg.de)
	o fig2dev can now be used in a pipe (e.g. cat x.fig | fig2dev -L ps ...)
	  was attempting to rewind file before
	o Two bugs fixed in eepic driver
		1) -l option didn't work because DPI was 0 when line width was
		   defined
		2) -W option produced 0 line widths because of a bad fprintf
	o Dash length incorrect by factor of 80 for LaTeX output
	o I18N support added for LaTeX output
	o Incorrect amount of memory allocated for reading eps pictures
	o Bug in provided strstr() (only used if you've uncommented
	  #define NOSTRSTR in the Imakefile)
	o Fixed M_PI incompatibility with RedHat 5.0
	o moved convert_names procedure from readxpm.c into genps.c since only
	  genps.c needs it.  Removed readxpm.c as a result.
	o added missing PCX import driver
	o metric scaling for latex part fixed
	  From Martin Pahl <pahl@tnt.uni-hannover.de>
	o Some Linuxes need -lgdbm instead of -ldbm (fig2dev/Imakefile)
	o transparent color for GIF was not passed (new option -t)
	o multiple co-incident points in splines caused problems on some
	  machines (this patch was in the old spline model but failed to make
	  it to the X-Spline model)
	o endpoints of splines were missing sometimes
	o new #ifdef for glibc which already has sys_errlist defined
	o conflict with definition M_PI (3.14159....) on RedHat systems fixed
	o "Ledger" paper size removed from list of paper sizes.  It is really
	  "Tabloid" size in landscape mode.
	o arrowheads were too far back from end of line
	o dash length for lines were too large in LaTeX output
	o fig2dev can now be used in a pipe (e.g. cat x.fig | fig2dev -L ps ...)
	  was attempting to rewind file before
	o error in I18N defines in fig2dev/Imakefile
	o buggy strstr() proc in fig2dev source replaced by xfig's version
	  (only used for systems that don't have their own strstr() )
	o bug fixes and modernization of Metafont driver by Mats Bengtsson
	  <mats.bengtsson@s3.kth.se>
