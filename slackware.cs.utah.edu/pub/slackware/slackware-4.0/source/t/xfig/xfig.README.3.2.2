Xfig is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects
interactively in an X window.  The resulting pictures can be saved, printed
on postscript printers or converted to a variety of other formats (e.g. to
allow inclusion in LaTeX documents).

xfig 3.2.2 is available from ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications/drawing_tools/xfig
or ftp://epb1.lbl.gov/xfig and usually from any CTAN (Comprehensive TeX Archive
Network) site such as ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/tex/ctan/.
See http://math.nmu.edu/Web/TeXArchives/ctansite.html for a long list of CTAN sites.

Be sure to set binary mode when transferring.

There is also an incremental patch file to convert from 3.2.1 to 3.2.2  This
is in the file xfig.3.2.1.to.3.2.2.  You may use the 'patch' program to
automatically apply the changes to your 3.2.1 release.  It is compressed so you
must uncompress it first or do "zcat xfig.3.2.1.to.3.2.2 | patch -p".

You also need to get TransFig version 3.2.1.  TransFig contains the post-
processor needed by xfig to convert fig files to one of several output formats,
such as PostScript, pic, LaTeX etc.  The TransFig package is in the directory
/contrib/applications/drawing_tools/transfig.

Please send email about any questions/bug fixes/contributions etc. about
TransFig or xfig to xfig-bugs@epb1.lbl.gov.

Following is a description of the CHANGES for 3.2.2:

=============================================================================
Version 3.2
=============================================================================

Patchlevel 2 (July 2, 1998)

BUGS FIXED:
	o Placing a library object caused xfig to die after recursing for a
	  long time 
	o Arrowheads in xfig 2.x files were incorrectly converted to 3.2.1
	  (they came out too large)
	o Imakefile didn't properly install Electrical/Physical and 
	  Electrical/Schematic directories
	o Some variables multiply defined in u_draw.c
	o Some systems' "install" program don't have the "-d" (create directory)
	  option so I have reworked the install part of the Imakefile
