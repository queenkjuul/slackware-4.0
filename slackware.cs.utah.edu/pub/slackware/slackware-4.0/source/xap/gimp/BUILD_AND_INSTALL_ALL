# This will build and install all required supporting libraries
# and the GIMP.  Although all of these libraries and programs use X, we are
# using /usr rather than /usr/X11R6 as the --prefix when building them. 
# Since at first glance most people will think this is the wrong place for
# them, here's the rationale behind this decision:
#
# 1. That's where the other distributions are placing it, so it seems like
#    an adhoc standard exception to the usual rule of no X11 binaries in 
#    /usr/bin.  I figure they've done this because of reason (2).
#
# 2. That's the only way to get the .m4 files for autoconf to install into
#    /usr/share/aclocal, where autoconf expects them to be.  I've tried moving
#    them manually from /usr/X11R6/share/aclocal to /usr/share/aclocal without
#    apparent ill effects, but this leaves a potential trap for the admin who
#    may try to rebuild newer versions of glib or gtk+ and doesn't know they
#    need to move these files after the 'make install'.  Duplicate .m4 files
#    (or worse, not exactly duplicate) *will* confuse autoconf and cause them
#    all sorts of random problems.
#
# So, although it's a bit icky to install this X11 stuff into /usr/lib and
# /usr/bin, it seems like the best option.  --pjv
