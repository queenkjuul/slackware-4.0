This is the official announcement of the release of gnuplot 3.7.
(Version 3.6 was renamed to 3.7 to avoid confusion with the many
BETA versions which are circulating within the Internet.)  The
official date and time of this version is:
        Date: Thu Jan 14 19:34:53 BST 1999
        Version: 3.7, Patchlevel 0

One of the most important changes in this release is the revised
copyright statement. gnuplot can now be distributed in binary form
even if the sources were modified, provided that the conditions
in the copyright statement are satisfied.

There are now two new official web sites for gnuplot:
http://members.theglobe.com/gnuplot/ and
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Foothills/6647/

Please note that the official gnuplot FAQ at
http://wwwfg.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ig25/gnuplot-faq.html/
is seriously out of date!

By the time you receive this, copies of gnuplot-3.7.tar.gz
should be at the official repositories. Binary versions for
various non-Unix platforms will be made available in the same
places. Please allow a couple of days for these distributions
to appear.

All distribution archives are signed with a public key, which is
available from public key servers.  For more information, see the
REAME and PGPKEYS file at the distribution sites.

----

 During the more than 5 years since the release of gnuplot version 3.5,
 many new features have been added:

 o integration of Carsten Grammes' gnufit extension
 o support for Win32/NT, OS9
 o new terminal drivers (eg. djsvga, emx, gif[1], HP 75550, Linux SVGA,
   png[2], texdraw)
 o dates and/or times, in various formats, can be used as input data
 o multiplot mode to plot several plots on the same page, window, or screen
 o greatly enhanced terminal drivers (X11, Amiga, OS/2, postscript, fig,
   pslatex)
 o new errorbar styles: boxerrorbars, financebars, candlesticks
 o greatly improved (mostly automatic) configuration on Unix platforms
 o greatly improved hidden3d algorithm
 o better postscript documentation
 o ... and a lot more

 [1] the gif terminal driver requires third party software. The gd graphics
     library version 1.3 or later can be downloaded from
     http://www.boutell.com/gd/

 [2] the png terminal driver requires third party software. The png graphics
     library and zlib can be downloaded from
     http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/pngcode.html
     and
     http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/
     respectively.

 The gnuplot team would like to thank everybody who has contributed
