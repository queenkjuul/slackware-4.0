Version:        1.85.4
Entered-date:   13 March 1996
Description:    db is no longer included in the official ELF libc package.
		I have made this release to make my own work available
		for other people.
                libdb is the Berkeley database library. It provides
                various functions to access a database. Note that is only
                a programmers database library. End users have nothing
                to do with it.
