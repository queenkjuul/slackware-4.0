This directory contains the XFree86 3.3.3 source.  The components are as
follows:

The full core source is split into three parts:

X333src-1.tar.bz2      The essential parts of the source

The other two archives are not included here, since they are fully
included in Slackware's X series:
X333src-2.tar.bz2      Fonts and documentation source
X333src-3.tar.bz2      Hard-copy documentation

The following contains some non-core clients, and is optional:

X333contrib.tar.bz2    Supported parts of the contrib distribution

For most purposes, X333src-1.tgz can be used alone providing the
building of fonts is disabled by setting 'BuildFonts' to NO in
xc/config/cf/host.def.

The source for the extract utility can be found in utils-1.0.0.tar.bz2

These patch files bring this source up to version XFree86-3.3.3.1:

3.3.3-3.3.3.1.diff.gz
doctools-1.0-1.0.1.diff.gz
