.TH UPGRADEPKG 8 "17 Mar 1999" "Slackware Version 4.0.0"
.SH NAME
upgradepkg \- upgrade Slackware packages.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B upgradepkg
.BI newpackagename
.BI [ newpackagename2 ]
.LP
.B upgradepkg
.BI oldpackagename%newpackagename
.BI [ old2%new2 ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B upgradepkg
upgrades a Slackware .tgz package from an older version to a
newer one.  It does this by
.B INSTALLING
the new package onto the system, and then
.B REMOVING 
any files from the old package that aren't in the new package.
If the old and new packages have the same name, a single argument is all that
is required.  If the packages have different names, supply the name of the
old package followed by a percent symbol (%), then the name of the new package.
Do not add any extra whitespace between pairs of old/new package names.
.TP
To upgrade in a directory other than / (such as /mnt):
.TP
ROOT=/mnt upgradepkg package.tgz
.SH BUGS
Before upgrading a package, save any configuration files (such as in /etc)
that you wish to keep.  Sometimes these will be preserved, but it depends on
the package structure.  If you want to force new versions of the config files
to be installed, remove the old ones manually prior to running upgradepkg.
