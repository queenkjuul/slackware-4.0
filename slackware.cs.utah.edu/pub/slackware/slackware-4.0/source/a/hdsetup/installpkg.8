.SH DESCRIPTION
.B installpkg
installs and creates *.tgz packages designed for use with the Slackware Linux
distribution. When you call 
.B installpkg
with the
.B \-r 
option, it will assume that you have created the structure for the 
package in the current directory (such as when you untar a package in a 
directory by itself). It will create entries for the package in 
/var/adm/packages and /var/adm/scripts, and will copy all the files from the
current directory and its subdirectories onto your root directory. If you
use the
.B \-m
option, it will not install the contents of the current directory, but will
make a *.tgz package using the name you have provided. Do not append the *.tgz
suffix to this name \-
.B installpkg
will do this for you automatically. The last, and probably most common use for
.B installpkg
is to install single or multiple Slackware compatible packages without having
to use the pkgtool or setup programs. Don't use any options for this; just 
provide
.B installpkg
with a list of packages to be installed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-warn packagename
Generate a report to the standard output about which files and directories
would be removed or overwritten if you install the package, but do not
actually install it.
.TP
.B \-m packagename
Make the contents of the current and subdirectories into a package with
the name <packagename>.tgz.
.TP
.B \-r packagename
Install the contents of the current and subdirectories as a package with
the name <packagename>.
.SH " "
It's possible to install to a directory other than root
by supplying
.B installpkg
with a
.B ROOT
environment variable:
.TP
.B ROOT=/mnt installpkg package.tgz
.SH BUGS
The
.B \-r
,
.B \-m
and
.B \-warn
options cannot be used together.
