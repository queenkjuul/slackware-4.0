Elvis 2.1 is now available for downloads from:

	ftp://ftp.cs.pdx.edu/pub/elvis/README.html  (main site)
	ftp://ftp.false.com/pub/elvis/README.html   (mirror)

Compared to the traditional vi, elvis adds the following features:

	* Runs under Unix, MS-DOS, Windows95/98/NT, and OS/2.
	* Multiple edit buffers, so you can edit several files at once.
	* Multiple windows, so you can see multiple edit buffers, or
	  different parts of the same edit buffer.
	* Multiple user interfaces, including graphical interfaces under
	  Windows95/98/NT and X11.
	* A variety of display modes, including syntax coloring and HTML.
	* Online help, with hypertext links.
	* Enhanced tags, to support overloading in C++.
	* Network support, so you can load/save files via FTP, or even use
	  elvis as a light-weight Web browser.
	* Aliases, which allow you to define new ex commands.
	* Built-in calculator

Compared to elvis 2.0, elvis 2.1 should be more stable (have fewer bugs).
It also adds the following features:

	* New ex commands, mostly intended to make elvis/ex scripts more
	  powerful and easier to write.
        * New ports: a graphical Win32 port, and a OS/2 port (text mode,
	  or X-windows via XFree86/2).
        * Improved X11 interface
        * Name completion, via the <Tab> key
        * Enhancements to tilde in a file name
        * Network protocols, so you can read/write via Web URLs.
        * "tex" display mode
        * Enhanced tags
        * The 'c' flag to the :s command
	* Lots of little things.
