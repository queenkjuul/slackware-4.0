  1.  Introduction


  NOTE: Great news: HP Deskjet 720, 820 and 1000 series printers are
  supported under Linux. Have a look at
  <http://www.rpi.edu/~normat/technical/ppa>


  1.1.  Welcome

  Welcome to the Linux Hardware Compatibility HOWTO. This document lists
  most of the hardware components (not computers with components build
  in) supported by Linux, so reading through this document you can
  choose the components for your own Linux computer. As the list of
  components supported by Linux is growing rapidly, this document will
  never be complete. So, when components are not mentioned in this
  HOWTO, the only reason will be that I don't know they are supported. I
  simply have not found support for the component and/or nobody has told
  me about support.

  Subsections titled Others list hardware with alpha or beta drivers in
  varying degrees of usability or other drivers that aren't included in
  standard kernels. Note that some drivers only exist in alpha kernels,
  so if you see something listed as supported but isn't in your version
  of the Linux kernel, upgrade.

  The latest version of this document can be found on
  <http://users.bart.nl/~patrickr/hardware-howto/Hardware-HOWTO.html>,
  SunSite and all the usual mirror sites. Translations of this and other
  Linux HOWTO's can be found at
  <http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/translations> and
  <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/translations>.
  If you know of any Linux hardware (in)compatibilities not listed here
  please let me know, just send mail.

  Still need some help selecting components after reading this document?
  Check the "Build Your Own PC" site at  <http://www.verinet.com/pc/>.

  1.3.  System architectures

  This document only deals with Linux for Intel platforms, for other
  platforms check the following:

    ARM Linux
     <http://www.arm.uk.linux.org/~rmk92/armlinux.html>

    Linux/68k

    Linux/8086
     <http://www.linux.org.uk/Linux8086.html>

    Linux/Alpha
     <http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/>

    Linux/MIPS
     <http://www.fnet.fr/linux-mips/>

    Linux/PowerPC
     <http://www.linuxppc.org/>

    Linux for Acorn
     <http://www.ph.kcl.ac.uk/~amb/linux.html>

    Linux for PowerMac
     <http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/os/Linux/mklinux/mkarchive/info/index.html>


  2.  Computers/Motherboards/BIOS

  ISA, VLB, EISA, and PCI buses are all supported.

  PS/2 and Microchannel (MCA) is supported in the standard kernel 2.0.7.
  There is support for MCA in kernel 2.1.16 and newer, but this code is
  still a little buggy. For more information you can always look at the
  Micro Channel Linux Home Page ( <http://glycerine.itsmm.uni.edu/mca/>)
  2.1.  Specific systems


    IBM PS/2 MCA systems
     <ftp://ftp.dcrl.nd.edu/pub/misc/linux/>

    EFA E5TX-AT motherboard has a solvable problem with RedHat Linux
     5.0 and possibly other versions of Linux. It spontaneously reboots
     while probing hardware. To solve, update BIOS to version 1.01. Get
     the BIOS update at
     <http://www.efacorp.com/download/Motherboard/e5tx101.exe>.

  Many new PCI boards are causing a couple of failure messages during
  boot time when "Probing PCI Hardware". The procedure presents the
  folowing message


      Warning : Unknown PCI device (8086:7100).  Please read include/linux/pci.h



  It tells you to read the pci.h file. From this file is the following
  quote


           PROCEDURE TO REPORT NEW PCI DEVICES
      We are trying to collect information on new PCI devices, using
      the standard PCI identification procedure. If some warning is
      displayed at boot time, please report
           - /proc/pci
           - your exact hardware description. Try to find out
             which device is unknown. It may be you mainboard chipset.
             PCI-CPU bridge or PCI-ISA bridge.
           - If you can't find the actual information in your hardware
             booklet, try to read the references of the chip on the board.
           - Send all that to linux-pcisupport@cao-vlsi.ibp.fr,
             and I'll add your device to the list as soon as possible

      BEFORE you send a mail, please check the latest linux releases
      to be sure it has not been recently added.

             Thanks
                   Frederic Potter.



  Normally spoken you motherboard and the unknown PCI devices will
  function correctly.


  2.2.  Unsupported


    Supermicro P5MMA with BIOS versions 1.36, 1.37 and 1.4. Linux will
     not boot on this motherboard. A new (beta) release of the BIOS
     which makes Linux boot, is available at
     <ftp.supermicro.com/mma9051.zip>

    Supermicro P5MMA98. Linux will not boot on this motherboard. A new
     (beta) release of the BIOS which makes Linux boot, is available at
     <ftp.supermicro.com/a98905.zip>?

    DataExpert Corp. ExpertColor TX531 V1.0 motherboard with chipset
     ACER M1531 (Date: 9729, TS6) and ACER M1543 (Date: 9732 TS6) seems
     not reproducible segmentations faults, kernel oops and kernel hangs
     under heavy load and tape access. The problem seems to be the PCI-
     bus, respectively the ACER chipset.


  3.  Laptops

  For more information about Linux and laptops, the following site is a
  good starting point.

    Linux Laptop Homepage
     <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/>

  Other information related to laptops can be found at the following
  sites:

    TI TravelMate 4000M
     <ftp://ftp.biomath.jussieu.fr/pub/linux/TM4000M-mini-HOWTO.txt.Z>

    TI TravelMate 5100

    Toshiba Satellite Pro 400CDT
     <http://terra.mpikg-teltow.mpg.de/~burger/T400CDT-Linux.html>


  3.2.  PCMCIA


    PCMCIA
     <http://hyper.stanford.edu/HyperNews/get/pcmcia/home.html>

  PCMCIA drivers currently support all common PCMCIA controllers,
  including Databook TCIC/2, Intel i82365SL, Cirrus PD67xx, and Vadem
  VG-468 chipsets.  Motorola 6AHC05GA controller used in some Hyundai
  laptops is not supported.  See Appendix B for a list of supported
  PCMCIA cards.



  4.  CPU/FPU

  Intel/AMD/Cyrix 386SX/DX/SL/DXL/SLC, 486SX/DX/SL/SX2/DX2/DX4 are
  supported. Intel Pentium, Pentium Pro and Pentium II (basically it's a
  Pentium Pro with MMX) also work. AMD K5 and K6 work good, although
  older versions of K6 should be avoided as they are buggy. Setting
  "internal cache" disabled in bios setup can be a workaround.

  Also IDT Winchip C6-PSME2006A processors are supported under Linux.

  Linux has built-in FPU emulation if you don't have a math coprocessor.

  Experimental SMP (multiple CPU) support is included in kernel 1.3.31
  and newer. Check the Linux/SMP Project page for details and updates.

    Linux/SMP Project
     <http://www.linux.org.uk/SMP/title.html>

  A few very early AMD 486DX's may hang in some special situations. All
  current chips should be okay and getting a chip swap for old CPU's
  should not be a problem.

  ULSI Math*Co series has a bug in the FSAVE and FRSTOR instructions
  that causes problems with all protected mode operating systems. Some
  older IIT and Cyrix chips may also have this problem.

  There are problems with TLB flushing in UMC U5S chips in very old
  kernels. (1.1.x)


    enable cache on Cyrix processors
     <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/CxPatch030.tar.z>

    Cyrix software cache control
     <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/linux.cxpatch>

    Cyrix 5x86 CPU register settings
     <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/cx5x86mod_1.0c.tgz>


  5.  Memory

  All memory like DRAM, EDO and SDRAM can be used with Linux. There is
  one thing you have to look at: normally the kernel is not supporting
  more than 64 Mb of memory. When you add more than 64 Mb of memory you
  have to add the following line to your LILO configuration file.


     append="mem=<number of Mb>M"



  So, when you have 96 Mb of memory this should become


     append="mem=96M"



  Don't type a number higher than the number Mb you really have. This
  can present unpredictable crashes.
  6.  Video cards

  Linux will work with all video cards in text mode, VGA cards not
  listed below probably will still work with mono VGA and/or standard
  VGA drivers.

  If you're looking into buying a cheap video card to run X, keep in
  mind that accelerated cards (ATI Mach, ET4000/W32p, S3) are MUCH
  faster than unaccelerated or partially accelerated (Cirrus, WD) cards.

  ``32 bpp'' is actually 24 bit color aligned on 32 bit boundaries. It
  does NOT mean the cards are capable of 32 bit color, they still
  display 24 bit color (16,777,216 colors). 24 bit packed pixels modes
  are not supported in XFree86, so cards that can do 24 bit modes to get
  higher resolutions in other OS's are not able to do this in X using
  XFree86. These cards include Mach32, Cirrus 542x, S3 801/805/868/968,
  ET4000, and others.

  AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) support is growing fast. Most of the
  X-servers (both freely available and commercial versions) have more or
  less support for AGP.


  6.1.  Diamond video cards

  Most currently available Diamond cards ARE supported by the current
  release of XFree86. Early Diamond cards may not be officially
  supported by XFree86, but there are ways of getting them to work.
  Diamond is now actively supporting the XFree86 Project.

  S.u.S.E. is building a serie of X-servers based on the XFree-86 code.
  These X-servers support new video cards and are bug fixe releases for
  XFree86 X-servers. S.u.S.E is building these X-servers together with
  The XFree86 Project, Inc. These X-Servers will be in the next XFree86
  version. These X-servers can be found at
  <http://www.suse.de/index.html>. At this moment S.u.S.E. X-Servers are
  available for the following video cards.

    XSuSE Tseng. W32, W32i ET6100 and ET6300 support.


  6.5.  Commercial X servers

  Commercial X servers provide support for cards not supported by
  XFree86, and might give better performances for cards that are
  supported by XFree86. In general they support many more cards than
  XFree86, so I'll onlys list cards that aren't supported by XFree86
  here. Contact the vendors directly or check the Commercial HOWTO for
  more info.

  ESDI controllers that emulate the ST-506 (MFM/RLL/IDE) interface will
  also work. The bad block checking comment also applies to these
  controllers.

  Generic 8 bit XT controllers also work.

  Other Controllers Supported:

    Tekram D690CD IDE PCI Cache Controller (with RAID level 1 Mirroring
     and caching)


  8.  Controllers (SCSI)

  It is important to pick a SCSI controller carefully. Many cheap ISA
  SCSI controllers are designed to drive CD-ROM's rather than anything
  else. Such low end SCSI controllers are no better than IDE. See the
  SCSI HOWTO and look at performance figures before buying a SCSI card.

  9.  Controllers (I/O)

  Any standard serial/parallel/joystick/combo cards. Linux supports
  8250, 16450, 16550, and 16550A UART's. Cards that support non-standard
  IRQ's (IRQ > 9) can be used.

  See National Semiconductor's ``Application Note AN-493'' by Martin S.
  Michael. Section 5.0 describes in detail the differences between the
  NS16550 and NS16550A. Briefly, the NS16550 had bugs in the FIFO
  circuits, but the NS16550A (and later) chips fixed those. However,
  there were very few NS16550's produced by National, long ago, so these
  should be very rare. And many of the ``16550'' parts in actual modern
  boards are from the many manufacturers of compatible parts, which may
  not use the National ``A'' suffix. Also, some multiport boards will
  use 16552 or 16554 or various other multiport or multifunction chips
  from National or other suppliers (generally in a dense package
  soldered to the board, not a 40 pin DIP). Mostly, don't worry about it
  unless you encounter a very old 40 pin DIP National ``NS16550'' (no A)
  chip loose or in an old board, in which case treat it as a 16450 (no
  FIFO) rather than a 16550A. - Zhahai Stewart <zstewart@hisys.com>

  Non-intelligent cards usually come in two varieties, one using
  standard com port addresses and use 4 IRQ's, and another that's AST
  FourPort compatible and uses a selectable block of addresses and a
  single IRQ. (Addresses and IRQ's are set using setserial.) If you're
  getting one of these cards, be sure to check which standard it
  conforms to, prices are no indication.

  11.  Network adapters

  Ethernet adapters vary greatly in performance. In general the newer
  the design the better. Some very old cards like the 3Com 3C501 are
  only useful because they can be found in junk heaps for $5 a time. Be
  careful with clones, not all are good clones and bad clones often
  cause erratic lockups under Linux. Read the Ethernet HOWTO,
  <http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/>, for detailed descriptions of
  various cards.

  12.3.  Unsupported

  The ASP chip on Sound Blaster 16 series is not supported. AWE32's
  onboard E-mu MIDI synthesizer is not supported.

  Nathan Laredo <laredo@gnu.ai.mit.edu> is willing to write AWE32
  drivers if you send him a complimentary card. He is also willing to
  write drivers for almost any hardware if you send him free samples of
  your hardware.

  Sound Blaster 16's with DSP 4.11 and 4.12 have a hardware bug that
  causes hung/stuck notes when playing MIDI and digital audio at the
  same time. The problem can happen with either Wave Blaster
  daughterboards or MIDI devices attached to the MIDI port. There is no
  known fix.


  13.  Hard drives

  All hard drives should work if the controller is supported.

  (From the SCSI HOWTO) All direct access SCSI devices with a block size
  of 256, 512, or 1024 bytes should work. Other block sizes will not
  work (Note that this can often be fixed by changing the block and/or
  sector sizes using the MODE SELECT SCSI command).

  Large IDE (EIDE) drives work fine with newer kernels. The boot
  partition must lie in the first 1024 cylinders due to PC BIOS
  limitations.

  Some Conner CFP1060S drives may have problems with Linux and ext2fs.
  The symptoms are inode errors during e2fsck and corrupt file systems.
  Conner has released a firmware upgrade to fix this problem, contact
  Conner at 1-800-4CONNER (US) or +44-1294-315333 (Europe). Have the
  microcode version (found on the drive label, 9WA1.6x) handy when you
  call.

  Certain Micropolis drives have problems with Adaptec and BusLogic
  cards, contact the drive manufacturers for firmware upgrades if you
  suspect problems.


    Multiple device driver (RAID-0, RAID-1)
     <ftp://sweet-smoke.ufr-info-p7.ibp.fr/public/Linux/>


  13.1.  Unsupported

  The following hard drives are mentioned as not supported by Linux.
  Read the bug report available.


    NEC D3817, D3827, D3847
     "These drives are slightly non-SCSI-2 compliant in the values
     reported in Mode Sense Page 3. In Mode Sense Page 3 all NEC D38x7
     drives report their sector size as zero. The NEC drives are the
     first brand of drive we have ever encountered that reported the
     sector size as zero. Unfortunately, that field in Mode Sense Page 3
     is not modifiable and there is no way to update the firmware on the
     D38x7 drives to correct this problem."


  14.  Tape drives



  14.1.  Supported


    SCSI tape drives
     (From the SCSI HOWTO) Drives using both fixed and variable length
     blocks smaller than the driver buffer length (set to 32k in the
     distribution sources) are supported. Virtually all drives should
     work. (Send mail if you know of any incompatible drives.)

    Iomega DITTO internal (ftape 3.04c and newer)


  14.2.  Others


    QIC-117, QIC-40/80, QIC-3010/3020 (QIC-WIDE) drives
     Most tape drives using the floppy controller should work. Various

  15.  CD-ROM drives

  For more information on CD-ROM drives check the CDROM-HOWTO at
  <http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/>.


  15.1.  Supported


  Common CD-ROM drives

    SCSI CD-ROM drives
     (From the CD-ROM HOWTO) Any SCSI CD-ROM drive with a block size of
     512 or 2048 bytes should work under Linux; this includes the vast
     majority of CD-ROM drives on the market.
    EIDE (ATAPI) CD-ROM drives (IDECD)
     Almost all double, quad and six speed drives are supported,
     including

    Mitsumi FX400

  15.3.  Notes

  All CD-ROM drives should work similarly for reading data. There are
  various compatibility problems with audio CD playing utilities.
  (Especially with newer low-end NEC drives.) Some alpha drivers may not
  have audio support yet.

  Early (single speed) NEC CD-ROM drives may have trouble with currently
  available SCSI controllers.

  PhotoCD (XA) is supported. The hpcdtoppm program by Hadmut Danisch
  converts PhotoCD files to the portable pixmap format. The program can
  be obtained from  <ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/hpcdtoppm> or as part
  of the PBM utilities.

  Also, reading video CD is supported in kernel series 2.1.3x and later.
  A patch is available for kernel 2.0.30.

  Finally, most IDE CD-ROM Changers are supported.


  16.  CD-Writers

  Many CD-Writers are supported by Linux now. For an up to date list of
  CD-Writers supported check the CD-Writing mini-HOWTO at
  <http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/CD-Writing>, check
  <http://www.shop.de/cgi-bin/winni/lsc.pl> or check

  17.  Removable drives

  All SCSI drives should work if the controller is supported, including
  optical (MO), WORM, floptical, Bernoulli, Zip, Jaz, SyQuest, PD, and
  others.


    Panasonic MO (combines a CD-ROM drive and an optical removable
     disk). You have to set a switch when configuring the kernel to get
     both part work at the same time.

    Parallel port Zip drives
     <ftp://gear.torque.net/pub/>

    Parallel port Avatar Shark-250
     <http://www.torque.net/shark.html>

  Removable drives work like hard disks and floppies, just fdisk/mkfs
  and mount the disks. Linux provides drive locking if your drives
  support it.  mtools can also be used if the disks are in MS-DOS
  format.

  CD-R drives require special software to work. Read the CD-R Mini-
  HOWTO.

  Linux supports both 512 and 1024 bytes/sector disks. Starting with
  kernel 2.1.32 Linux also supports 2048 bytes/sector. A patch to kernel
  2.0.30 is available at <http://liniere.gen.u-tokyo.ac.jp/2048.html>.

  The 2048 bytes/sector support is needed for

    Fujitsu magneto-optical disk drives M2513

  Starting with pre-patch-2.0.31-3 IDE/ATAPI internal Zip drives,
  flopticals and PD's are supported.

    Microsoft Intellimouse



  18.3.  Notes

  Touchpad devices like Alps Glidepoint also work, so long they're
  compatible with another mouse protocol.

  Newer Logitech mice (except the Mouseman) use the Microsoft protocol
  and all three buttons do work. Eventhough Microsoft's mice have only
  two buttons, the protocol allows three buttons.

  The mouse port on the ATI Graphics Ultra and Ultra Pro use the
  Logitech busmouse protocol.  (See the Busmouse HOWTO for details.)


  19.  Modems

  All internal modems or external modems connected to the serial port
  should work. Alas, some manufactures have created Windows 95 only
  modems. Check Appendix D for Linux incompatible hardware.

  A small number of modems come with DOS software that downloads the
  control program at runtime. These can normally be used by loading the
  program under DOS and doing a warm boot. Such modems are probably best
  avoided as you won't be able to use them with non PC hardware in the
  future.

  All PCMCIA modems should work with the PCMCIA drivers.

  Fax modems need appropriated fax software to operate. Also be sure
  that the fax part of the modem supports Class 2 or Class 2.0. It seems
  to be generally true for any fax software on unix that support for
  Class 1.0 is not available.

  20.  Printers/Plotters

  All printers and plotters connected to the parallel or serial port
  should work. Alas, some manufacturers have created Windows 95 only
  printers. Check Appendix D for Linux incompatible hardware.

  NOTE: for the ViRGE/VX,DX,GX,GX2 chipsets you need XFree86 3.3.1. You
  should use the XF86_SVGA server.


  26.  Appendix B. Supported PCMCIA cards


  These cards are supported by David Hinds' PCMCIA package and this list
  is taken from his web page.



  26.1.  Ethernet cards


    SMC, Megahertz and Ositech cards use the smc91c92_cs driver

    3Com and Farallon cards use the 3c589_cs driver

    Fujitsu, TDK, RATOC, CONTEC, Eagle and Nextcom cards use the
     fmvj18x_cs driver

     All other cards use the pcnet_cs driver. Other NE2000-compatible
     cards that are not on the list are also likely to work with
     pcnet_cs.

  These programs allow ISA Plug-And-Play devices to be configured
  on a Linux machine.

  This program is suitable for all systems, whether or not they
  include a PnP BIOS.



  Commands have been taken from the Plug and Play ISA specification
  Version 1.0a. ( <ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/pnp/docs/>)

  More information on ISA PnP utilities can be found on the website of
  Peter Fox:  <http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/>

  Please let me know about hardware (not normally supported under Linux)
  which can be put to work with the aid of these utilities. A list of
  this hardware will be put in this appendix.


  28.  Appendix D. Linux incompatible Hardware

  Some hardware manufacturers have created devices which are compatible
  with MS-Dos and Windows 95 only. They seem to emulate part of the
  normally available hardware in the devices by software packages sold
  together with the device. Specification on these devices are not
  presented to the world so it is almost impossible to write drivers for
  these devices. Below a list of devices reported as being Linux
  incompatible will be given.

  Simply put, it is best to avoid hardware which states things like
  "Needs Windows" or "Windows only".

     AGP
        Accelerated Graphics Port. A bus interconnect mechanism designed
        to improve performance of 3D graphics applications. AGP is a
        dedicated bus from the graphics subsystem to the core-logic
        chipset.

     ATAPI
        AT Attachment Packet Interface. A new protocol for controlling
        mass storage devices similar to SCSI protocols. It builds on the
        ATA (AT Attachment) interface, the official ANSI Standard name
        for the IDE interface developed for hard disk drives. ATAPI is
        commonly used for hard disks, CD-ROM drives, tape drives, and
        other devices.

     RAID
        Redudant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks. The basic idea of RAID is
        to combinr multiple small, inexpensive disk drives into an array
        of disk drives which yields performance exceeding that of a
        single large expensive drive. There are five type of redundant
        array Architectures; RAID-1 through RAID-5. A non-redudant array
        of disk drives is referred to as RAID-0.
