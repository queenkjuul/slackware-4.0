  1.  Introduction

  Some unused piece of delicious hardware floating around on my desk.
  Screaming to be used. 40 Mb's of ram and a 403 PPC inside.

  So I decided to give it a try and connect it to my local Linux
  network.  I want to thank the company I work for because they gave me
  the chance to experiment with it.

  In this (Mini-Howto) we'll be dealing with an IBM Network Station
  model 8361-100, other models may be featured in the future.

  It`s trying to describe how I setup the NC, there are probably lots of
  other ways to set up this machine, this one works fine.  Any other
  remarks you might have from your own experience is welcome.  (Free
  Hardware also ;-))

  This MINI Howto is not trying to be the Bible on NC's and Linux, its
  trying to be something for you to get started from nowhere.
  Contributions to this NC are welcome



  Things we still have to implement in this Howto

    How to export your homedir

    How to run applications

    How to run Java Applets


  2.  Requirements

  2.1.  Hardware


  An NC, connected to your local Network, most likely by UTP, thus by a
  cross-cable or HUB connecting to an X Server. Herafter called the
  Linux Box. Basically the NC is Made to work with either AS/400 ,
  Windows NT or AIX Servers. These are all expensive solutions,  however
  working with thin clients doesnt have to cost that much.

  The model I have at my disposal is an IBM Network Station model
  8361-100, On the inside you can find an 403PPC chip, some S3 vga
  components, an PCMCIA slot, and normal 72pins (parity ??) sims.  I
  found 8+32 Mb in my edition.

  Actually those 40Mb were major overkill.  In full operation modus the
  NC only uses about with lot's of configuration panels a couple of
  telnet sessions and a X -query open only took up about 4Mb of ram.  )
  So taking out the 32Mb showed absolutely no significant loss of speed.



  We proved it was no problem setting it up on a Linux only network.
  You`ll need a server that can provide you both with about 25Mb of free
  diskspace for the software, and the capacities to run a X -query.   In
  the setup overhere we used a 486DX50 with 8Mb as a fileserver and I
  switch between another  486DX266 (PS/2 85) with 32Mb, and my Multia
  with 48Mb as the X server Off course, the fatster machines the better.


  2.2.  Software



  2.2.1.  IBM Software.


  NC Kernel, fonts etc.

  In order to boot the NC you will need its Kernel and fonts.  About
  25Mb of files are needed on the server.  They can be found on an AIX
  4.X with the Netstation modules installed.  Or from the IBM Netstation
  Download Page





  2.2.2.  NFS Server.

  A working NFS server, like in every default Linux distribution.
  Approx 85Mb of diskspace has to be exported to the NC.



  2.2.3.  X Server.

  Any machine running XDM with enough memory, processor power will do.
  You don't need to have X configured on the machine itselve, it can
  perfectly be a monitorless server. Basic X Windows install will
  provide you with the necessary deamons.




  Optionally


  2.2.4.  If you have multiple NC's, you may wish to distribute the IP
  Adresses by using a DHCP Server how to obtain and configure a DHCP
  server can be read in the DHCP Mini Howto on sunsite DHCP Server



  3.  Other Usefull Documentation

  Mainly the IBM website.  It contains lot's of docuentation on the NC,
  most of it can be found in the .pdf format.

  Latest updates can be found at

  4.  Setting up the Serverside

  You found all the software you needed.  Now let's install them.

  4.1.  AIX License

  Before making the tarball on the aix machine, make sure you run
  /usr/netstation/bin/agree in order to make the kernel in a usable
  format.  Probably you will have to do the same thing with the tarball
  you get from the IBM website.  So finding the kernel separatly might
  be another solution.  Find some drive with about 25Mb of free
  diskspace, I use /usr/netstation/, and unpack the tarbal either from
  the IBM website or from an AIX machine.  There is no need in leaving
  the approx 60Mb from /usr/netstation/doc on the disk if you don't have
  enough diskspace.

  4.2.  The Real Operating System



  4.2.1.  Setting up the nfs server

  Edit your /etc/exports, add the line /usr/netstation   10.0.0.50(rw)
  Where 10.0.0.50 is the ipnr you want to give to the NC.  Restart your
  nfs deamon.

  [root@velvet sdog]# ps auxf |grep rpc sdog      4145  0.0  5.8   828
  384  p1 S   03:55   0:00          \_ grep rpc root      3120  0.0  5.7
  944   380  ?  S  Feb 27   0:00 rpc.mountd root      3129  0.0  1.5
  880   100  ?  S  Feb 27   0:10 rpc.nfsd [root@velvet sdog]# kill -9
  3120 3129 ; /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd ; /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd

  or on a RedHat alike system easier

  [root@velvet init.d]# pwd /etc/rc.d/init.d [root@velvet init.d]# ./nfs
  restart Restarting NFS services: rpc.nfsd rpc.mountd done.
  [root@velvet init.d]#

  Your NC should now be able to mount the /usr/netsation by NFS.

  Bascially if you don`t need X-Windows this is as far as it gets.  You
  can easily telnet from your NC with nothing more installed.  Hoever
  the beauty of this thing is it`s X capacities

  4.2.2.  Setting up the X server

  Next we have to set up the X server.  Basically I didn`t need to set
  up anything, all of my machines that ran X-Windows were configured to
  accept connections.  I just started up the NC for the first time and
  it showed me all the machines that ran an XDM (cfr running an X
  -indirect).  So any machine that can run xdm can be used as X Server.
  Just make sure XDM is So any machine that can run xdm can be used as X
  Server.  Just make sure XDM is started.

  Everything on the server side should be setup now.  Lets try the NC
  side.



  5.  Configuring the Thin Client

  Unplug the network cable from the NC. Then boot it up.

  It will boot after checking its Memory, VGA etc, in a screen IBM
  Network Station Setup Utility.  Basically you can manage everything
  from this menu system.  The main parts will be described here.

  5.1.  Setting up TCP/IP

  Section 5 (F5) : Your network setup should look something like this :

  IP Addressed From                                NVRAM Network Station
  IP Adress                        10.0.0.50 First Boot Host IP Adress
  10.0.0.1 Second Boot Host IP Adress                       10.0.0.11
  Third Boot Host IP Adress                        0.0.0.0 Gateway IP
  Adress                                10.0.0.1 Subnet Mask
  255.255.255.0 Broadcast IP Adress
  10.0.0.255 Ethernet Standard                                Version 2


  Resembles my setup.  The NC itselve has 10.0.0.50 While 10.0.0.1 is
  the NFS Server, 10.0.0.11 is a secondary NFS server, just in case.




  5.2.  Setting Up the Boot Parameters

  Section 6 (F6): Looks like this in my setup.

  Boot file                               kernel TFTP Boot Directory
  /usr/netstation/ NFS Boot Directory
  /usr/netstation/ Configuration File
  /usr/netstation/configs/standard.nsm Configuration Directory
  /usr/netstation/configs TFTP Order                              2 NFS
  Order                               1 MOP Order
  Disabled Local Order                             Disabled

  Where /usr/netstation is the directory export on 10.0.0.1


  5.3.  Setting Up the Monitor

  Section 7 (F7): You can choos the right resolution / Refresh rate from
  a nice menu.  I have mine running on an old 14" VGA Screen running in
  1024x768 @60Hz


  Basically thats all you need to install.

  Just plug in your Network cable again. And Reboot the NC.  After
  testing the  Video / DRAM, the NC will search the Host system and
  request the startup information, download the Kernel from the NFS and
  boot up.

  It might occur that the NC first gets a new FirmWare  and upgrades it


  When starting the graphical Console you should get a menu bar and a
  screen where you can select the X Hosts.  You are now in the CLE
  (Common Login Environment): it's a desktop from where you can start
  all sessions, either telnet or X .  It uses a local window manager
  which is a small window manager based on Motiv.


  Your NC is setup now. Congratulations


  5.4.  Further Configuration

  Further configuration of the NC can e.g. be setting the colors, window
  sizes, default keymaps etc.  I'm not going to describe these in
  detail.  If you have troubles finding your way through the menu
  system. The IBM Network Station Runtime Environment for RS/6000 User's
  Guide  which can be found in either .pdf or .ps at
  http://www.as400.ibm.com/networkstation/rs6000/ and will provide you
  with detailed information.


  6.  Misc Stuf


  6.1.  TroubleShooting

  Q:  I get an Invalid Kernel Type while tryng to boot the NC.  A: You
  didn't run the agree script.  Q: I log in at the remote host and my
  keyboard settings fuck up.  A: I use no .Xmodap when working on the
  NC.  This keeps my keyboardsettings perfect.




  6.2.  Experiences

  Using the NC as a plain terminal with multiple consoles.  The Built-in
  Motiv extensions are a lot easier to use than the default setup ;-)
  Pressing the Pause/Break key will pop up the NC Menu at any time.


  6.2.1.  Port 5978

  Remote Logging It`s the same as the messages console in your CLE.


  6.2.2.  Port 5999

  Remote managment for the NC This is acutally a call for help.
  Strobing the NC , I found some usefull ports.  Among them 5999,  I
  still haven't found the exact way how to deal with it.  However here
  are some commands that showed me to be usefull.  You can apparently
  configure the NC remotely.

    help

    get boot

    get tcpip

    get file

    get nfs

    get tftp

  Lots of thanks must go out to Wouter Cloetens,
  wcloeten@raleigh.ibm.com for getting me started and to Bart Geens
  ,Bart.Geens@advalvas.be for rereading this howto and findin uot lost
  of splelling errosr

  If somebody has more info on these, help is welcome. They seem to be
