  1.  Introduction

  The main goal of this document is to get your system running with your
  cable modem, and cable internet provider. Unfortunately, many ISPs
  that provide cable modem services, give you Windows and Macintosh
  software only.

  This document attempts to explain how to setup some cable modems and
  internet providers in Linux, the tricks to get them working correctly,
  and the traps not to fall down. It is hoped that this document will
  assist you, however we make no claims for the validity of the
  information contained within.

  2.  Setting up your Ethernet Card

  All of the setups below use ethernet cards (network cards) to connect
  you somehow to the Internet. That is why first we need to check if
  your ethernet card is working and most importantly can be used (read
  is supported) in Linux. There is a comprehensive Ethernet HOWTO at

  if you would like to read it otherwise try this.


  Boot into Linux, During boot up a message like this should appear...

   eth0: 3c509 at 0x300 tag 1, 10baseT port, address  00 20 af ee 01 23,
  IRQ 10.
  3c509.c:1.07 6/15/95 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov

  If you missed it type dmesg.

  If you see a message like that you are set and you can go to the next
  section. If you can't see a message like this there are two possible
  explanations, your ethernet card is PNP (plug-n-play) and you need to
  use tools such as isapnptools to get it recognized (I am not quite
  sure on this because I don't have a single PNP card so correct me if I
  am wrong). The other explanation is that you need to set up your card.

  Most cards today come with DOS programs that are used to setup your
  card. For example to get my 3COM 3c509 to work all I needed to do is
  boot into DOS and use a utility to configure my card. There is usually
  a Auto Configure option. If that does not solve your problem try
  changing the IRQ for the card using the same utility. I find that
  usually IRQs 10,11 and 12 work well. If none of this solves your
  problem please read the Ethernet HOWTO referenced above or post to a
  newsgroup such as comp.os.linux.setup or comp.os.linux.networking.


  3.  Regular Cable Modem ISPs

  If you think you have the card recognized you have to now look at the
  entry for your ISP. I have sorted the information according to a
  provider because setups are mostly ISP specific.


  3.1.  MediaOne Express

  MediaOne Express is a Internet cable service provided by MediaOne. The
  hardware setup consists of a cable modem produced by LanCity or
  General Instruments which plugs into an ethernet card using a 10BaseT
  (UTP-45) cable. Assignment of IP addresses and other networking
  information is done using DHCP which stands for Dynamic Host
  Configuration Protocol. The only thing you need to do is read the DHCP
  mini-HOWTO and configure your system appropriately. There is no other
  necessary configuration. DHCP mini-HOWTO can be found at
  Information about MediaOne Service can be found at .



  3.2.  @Home

  @Home uses a similar setup to ``MediaOne''.  However, there are a few
  fundamental differences, outlined by contributors. Since @Home spans
  different geographic locations you might get assigned different kind
  of equipment and have slightly different kind of setups.



  Before you try anything, go to control panel, network, and properties
  for your network card. Write down all of the information. You will
  need it later.



  TCI, the company that runs @Home issues a Etherlink III 3c509b NIC for
  all of their customers. What TCI does not tell you is that when they
  install your ethernet card, it is in PnP mode. Now in Slakware, if you
  uncomment the proper line for this card, everything will appear to be
  working fine. There will be no system problems, but the 'PC' light on
  your CyberSURFR modem will never turn on. If you are using Slakware,
  and are having this problem, reboot in DOS and skip the next
  paragraph.


  In RedHat5, your system will have some trouble autodetecting the card.
  If you try to pass the paramaters manually, the system will hang. This
  should be obvious that your card is not setup properly. Before wasting
  anymore time, reboot in DOS (This is a must because as of 12/25/97,
  there is no utility written for Linux to turn off PnP and turn on
  ISA.)


  TCI does not give out a utility disk for your ethernet card, so you
  must download the utility from one of 3Com's sites. Here is a link to
  3COM's page for driver download.



  Once you have downloaded your driver files you will need to run them
  and disable the PNP mode of your network card.


  What you've now done will make your ethernet card 'broken' in Windows
  95. You'll need to go to Control Panel, Network, and remove the
  network card and the adapter. Reboot your computer, and again go back
  to control panel. Go to add/remove new hardware, and have it
  autodetect. It will automatically setup the correct i/o address for
  you. You will most likely need to reboot again. Now you should be in
  Windows 95, with the 'PC' light on your cable modem on. You will also
  notice that none of your internet applications seem to work, you can't
  ping, and you can't resolve DNS. You now must go back to control
  panels, network, and click on properties for your network card (not
  the adapter). Re-enter all the data you wrote down, and reboot.


  With a little luck, your ethernet card should be working in Windows
  95, and ready to rock in Linux.


  If you live Hampton Roads, VA you should read a little note from Mark
  Solomon
  With the @home service in Hampton Roads, VA, it is absolutly
  neccessary to run dhcpcd-0.70 (or higher) that supports the "-h"
  option to specify the hostname of your computer.  Without this switch
  the @home dhcpcd server will not assign addresses.



  More information on setting up dhcpcd-0.70 and @Home service with
  Intel Ether Express cards can be found at



  Notes for Baltimore, MD and Colleyville,TX:



  In Baltimore subscribers are issued Intel Ether Express Pro 10 nics
  and a static IP number.


  Information about @Home Service can be found at .


  3.3.  RoadRunner

  RoadRunner is an Internet cable service provided by Excalibur Group
  (Time Warner). The hardware setup consists of a cable modem produced
  by Motorola and Toshiba which plugs into an ethernet card using a
  10BaseT (UTP-45) cable. From what I can gather RR uses DHCP for IP
  assignment. In order to set up Linux to use DHCP you need to read the
  DHCP mini-HOWTO and configure your system appropriately. DHCP mini-
  HOWTO can be found at



  If this doesn't work out for you you should check out

  for Akron, Ohio and

  for San Diego, California. It might help solve your problem.



  Another good site is .



  Information about RoadRunner Service can be found at .


  3.4.  Rogers Wave


  The hardware setup consists of a cable modem produced by LanCity which
  plugs into an ethernet card using a 10BaseT (UTP-45) cable.


  When the cable modem is installed by Rogers Wave technicians you are
  assigned a static IP address. They should also provide you with
  information on your subnet mask, router (gateway) numbers and DNS
  numbers.  For additional info please visit .


  Other information about Rogers Wave Service can be found at .


  3.5.  Sunflower Cablevision

  This information is provided by Andrew Novick:


  "I recently saw your cable modem howto and I have an addition.
  Sunflower Cable is a company stricly in Lawrence KS, however we have a
  rather large Linux community because of the University of Kansas. On
  our local LUG mailing list, we are starting to get more and more
  questions on how to configure their linux machine for the cable modem.
  It is just regular static addressing, and the modem is made by
  Zenith."



  To configure your Linux box make sure you get all the pertinent
  information from the Cablevision tech support or use these.




    IP address: Assigned by SunFlower Cablevision

    Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

    Gateway (router) address: 24.124.11.254

    Hostname: Assigned by SunFlower Cablevision

    Domain name: lawrence.ks.us

    Primary DNS server (nameserver): 24.124.0.1

    Secondary DNS server (nameserver): 24.124.0.6



  Have all those numbers written down before you proceed.  To register,
  visit


  To register in the lawrence.ks.us domain contact Stephen Spencer at

  gladiatr@artorius.sunflower.com



  Under RedHat use Control Panel and Network Configuration to put in
  these numbers. Just say Add Interface, Device type=Ethernet, Device
  name=eth0 (this is zero not O in eth0) then fill out all the fields.
  Then click activate.



  In Slackware type netconfig. When you are finished reboot and you
  should be up and running.


  If this doesn't work make sure you do network card troubleshooting
  from the beginning of this document.






  3.6.  Jones Intercable

  This information is provided by Bob Kimble:

  Jones Internet Cable supplies a Hybrid cable modem that connects to
  your machine / network via 10BaseT ethernet. They provide you with a
  static IP address for your machine, and another static IP address for
  the modem. The modem acts as a gateway to their network. Your IP
  address and the modem IP address are on the same network and have the
  same network mask (in my case 255.255.255.0 -- 24 bits). They also
  provide two DNS IP addresses which you enter into your configuration.
  I just entered the numbers when I installed Red Hat Linux 5 and it
  worked like a champ from the beginning.  Since then I have configured
  my Linux machine to enable IP masquerading and domain name services,
  and it now acts as a router for my entire private network. My other
  machines are connected via a private network using the addresses
  192.168.0.x. They are running Windows 95, Windows NT (Intel and Alpha)
  and OS/2. My Linux machine has two IP addresses -- the one from the
  cable company and one from the 192.168.0.x private network. Everything
  works like a champ. All six machines can browse the web
  simultaneously. My kids are even able to connect to their favorite
  game site, "The Realm" from Sierra.



  3.7.  GTE Worldwind

  This information is provided by Mike Hughes:

  The information you provided for Rogers Wave works for GTE WorldWind
  cable modem services also.  However, GTE's service is EXTREMELY slow,
  barely faster than ISDN.  more information at





  3.8.  SpeedChoice, Phoenix, Arizona


  According to Micah peenchee@asu.edu:



  Just thought I'd let you know that in my area (Phoenix, AZ, usa) there
  is a company called speedchoice that provides cable modem service.
  The service uses a hybrid cable modem and the set up is almost
  identical to that of Jones intercable described in the howto.  See
  ``Jones Cable''. For any other issues mail Micah.


  3.9.  Cedar Falls Cybernet, Iowa


  This information is provided thanks to Joe Breu breu@cfu.net



  We are an ISP in Cedar Falls, Iowa that uses the Zenith HomeWorks
  Universal over our own Hybrid Fiber/Coax system.  Our system uses no
  proprietary connection software and is straight TCP/IP connections.
  We do use DHCP, but will offer static IP addresses to customers
  requesting them because they cannot use DHCP.



  3.10.  Telstra Bigpond Cable, Australia


  This information is provided by Geoff Conway
  gconway@vic.bigpond.net.au



  Disclaimer:


  The information contained herein is in no way the responsibility of
  Big Pond Cable, Telstra Multimedia, Telstra, IBM Global Services
  Australia or any related company. Any loss or consequential damage
  associated with the attempted installation of the Big Pond Cable Linux
  software is the PERSONAL responsibility of whomsoever follows these
  instructions.



  Big Pond Cable does not currently support Linux - so do not report
  faults to them regarding any aspect of the Linux installation and/or
  operation.



  Big Pond Cable Linux Installation Notes. V 1.1 (12/03/98)



  Change Note 1.1 12/3/98 - Corrected spelling of dhcpcd & rrdhcpcd



  Linux is not officially supported by Big Pond Cable.  However, the TMM
  cable infrastructure does allow Linux to be used - with the
  appropriate login client.  The following installation notes should
  allow you to install the Linux software without too many difficulties.


  The full client distribution of rrclientd was obtained from:



  I am running RedHat version 5 of Linux - but the documentation
  indicates that it will work with other releases.

  Note that there is also more information in the rrclientd release than
  is documented here.

  Procedure:


    Copy the distribution file  rrclientd-1.3.tar.gz to your Linux PC.

    Login as root for all of the following :-

    Expand the distribution (with gunzip) & then untar it.

    In directory rrclientd-1.3/bin you will find all the executables
     that you need: fetchmail (not used) kdestroy kinit rdate rrclientd
     rrdhcpcd rrpasswd




    Rename /sbin/dhcpcd to /sbin/dhcpcd.orig. Copy & rename  rrdhcpcd
     to /sbin/dhcpcd

    Copy kdestroy,kinit,rdate,rrclientd,rrdhcpd,rrpasswd to
     /usr/local/bin

    Set up your ethernet card to use dhcp & restart the system. If the
     dhcp configuration is ok - an IP address will be assigned - with
     the details being places in /etc/dhcpc/hostinfo-eth0 &
     /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf

     You may see a startup warning about not finding dhcp.conf - this
     doesn't seem to matter.

     ** At this point you should be able to ping proxy-server
     successfully.

     (If you can't then you won't be able to login later)


    Copy the krb5.ini file (from your Win95 \netmanag directory) to
     /etc/krb5.conf

     You will need to make the following changes (adding 2 new sections)

     The example shown is for the Melbourne krb5.ini file - Sydney users
     will need to substitute appropriately.

     This is also documented in the distribution's examples/ sub-
     directories.

    Save your existing services file /etc/services to
     /etc/services.orig

     Copy the services file from examples/Nassau/services to
     /etc/services


    Create a new file /etc/rrpasswd - with the contents being your
     current BPC password


    Change the PATH environment variable as follows

     PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin ; export PATH (This is most likely not
     necessary)


    Login to BPC as follows

     rrclientd -u <username> /etc/rrpasswd dce-server

     so if you're username jsmith

     rrclientd -u jsmith /etc/rrpasswd dce-server

     If this is successful you'll see a message in /var/log/messages
     indicating it was ok.

     tail /var/log/messages will display the end of the file.


    Logout of BPC by entering rrclientd -k

    To make this automatic - you'll need to set the PATH & invoke
     rrclientd each time the system boots.

    The rrpasswd command has NOT been tried.

    That's it - setup your Linux Netscape proxies & go for it !!

    According to the documentation the client will logout & then login
     automatically at 3am. This has not been checked.



  Problems


  If you don't setup the PATH properly - then the login will fail with
  GSS_API complaints about non-supported checksum type.

  If you don't make the needed changes to krb5.conf  you'll also get a
  similar error.

  If you are using your PC to dual/triple boot between W95/NT/Linux -
  the PC's CMOS clock will be altered by Linux - giving continual
  Kerberos errors if you try & login using NT. You need to login using
  Win95 first (which will fix the CMOS clock settings), then you can get
  in via NT.

  Make sure you setup you PC time/timezone correctly in Linux. Note also
  that the /var/log/messages timestamps are a bit strange :) (possibly
  referenced to GMT)



  3.11.  Fibertel, Buenos Aires, Argentina


  This information is provided by Pablo Godel



  My name is Pablo Godel and want report that I'm using the cable
  service of Fibertel in Buenos Aires, Argentina and it works perfectly
  with Linux.

  They gave me a static IP. The brand of the cablemodem is COM21 and the
  model is ComPort.

  I connect it to the nic properly, configured in Linux and it worked
  perfectly.


  More information about Fibertel can be found at


  3.12.  Videotron, Canada


  I don't have much information about Videotron except the fact that
  they use DHCP for the assignment of IP addresses and other networking
  information. Just read the DHCP mini-HOWTO
  (http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/DHCP.html) and configure your
  system appropriately. There is no other necessary configuration.



  Additional information from Mihai Petre (mihaip@videotron.ca):



  Yes they are using DHCP for the tcp settings. They have also included
  dhcpcd on their ftp server at ().  Of course that the tech. support
  cannot help u for the linux related stuff.



  They don't allow setup of any kind of servers on your machine (on
  ports 80,21,110,25) so the only thing is to use some "exotics" ports.



  Information about Videotron can be found at






  3.13.  Telekabel (Teleweb), Austria


  According to Andreas Kostyrka:




    You may want to mention, that the Austrian Telekabel (Teleweb) ISP
     works with Linux. It seems quite similiar like MediaOne Express
     (3c509+dhcp, etc.)

    Second there are 3COM configuration utilities for Linux (But don't
     fool around with them on a busy system, 3c509 may lock the bus if
     touched the wrong way :( ):





  Information about Telekabel can be found at





  3.14.  Tebecai, Netherlands


  According to Frodo Looijaard:



  Tebecai is yet another provider which uses a LANcity cable modem
  connected to a 10BaseT ethernet card. DHCP is used for configuration
  (see the DHCP mini-HOWTO at
  http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/DHCP.html).  A step-by-step
  guide to install the cable modem under Linux can be found at

  (in dutch), but it is really very straightforward. You must only
  remember that your IP-address is not visible from the Internet (it is
  on the private 10.x.y.z subnet), so you can not setup a publicly
  available server.



  Information about Tebecai can be found at

  (in dutch only).


  3.15.  A2000, Netherlands


  This information is provided by Johan List J.A.List@speed.A2000.nl:



  Basically the way to go is the same as with Tebecai.  A2000 provides
  cable internet access by means of a LANCity cable modem, connected to
  an 10BaseT ethernet card. This also works well for the
  "Vortex/Boomerang" cards by 3COM (I've got a 3COM Boomerang Fast
  Etherlink XL 10/100Mb TX Ethernet Adapter), providing you compile the
  Vortex/Boomerang drivers. (See the Linux Ethernet-HOWTO)



  Setting up access can be done with DHCP (See the DHCP-Mini-HOWTO).  A
  Dutch guide to setting up Internet access for A2000 is available at .



  Contrary to Tebecai, your IP-number *is* visible from the Internet, so
  take your precautions regarding security and safety when setting up a
  Linux machine using A2000 Internet access!!



  3.16.  Shaw Cable, Canada


  According to Peng F. Mok pmok@shaw.wave.ca:


  I recently signed up for a cable modem service from Shaw Cable here in
  Canada, which they have christened `Shaw Wave'.  They also appear to
  have another service called `Shaw@Home' which they are using in some
  locations.  Shaw has been upgrading their cable network for about a
  year and a half now, and now offer cable-modem service to a number of
  locations across Canada.  Information about the `Shaw Wave' service
  can be found at

  while information about the `Shaw@Home' service can be found at

  General information about Shaw Cable can be found at



  I thought I'd just drop you a line to inform you that your  DHCP mini-
  HOWTO, (http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/DHCP.html) was very
  useful in helping me set up Linux to work with my cable-modem service,
  and that you might want to add `Shaw Wave' (and perhaps `Shaw@Home')
  to your Cable-Modem mini-HOWTO as another entry explaining how to set
  up Linux with the service.  I don't have specific information on the
  `Shaw@Home' service yet, but from conversations I've had with Shaw
  technical support it seems that `Shaw@Home' is a partnership with
  ```@Home''' and involves the same features and setup procedure as that
  already described for ```@Home''' in the Cable-Modem mini-HOWTO
  document.



  In both services Shaw Cable techs will come over and bring you two
  pieces of hardware -- a Motorola CyberSURFR cable-modem and either a
  3Com EtherLink III 16-Bit ISA 3C509B-TPO NIC or an EtherLink XL PCI
  3C900-TPO NIC.  You have your choice of either an ISA or a PCI card
  depending on your needs, and these models only have the RJ-45 (UTP)
  connectors.  The ISA cards come with PnP-mode enabled by default, so
  it may be necessary to boot into DOS, disable PnP operation, and
  configure the card to some base I/O address and IRQ setting which are
  available.  Once this is done Linux should have no problems detecting
  the NIC at boot-time.  I'm not sure about what needs to be done in the
  case of a PCI card since I don't currently have a PC which supports
  either PCI or PnP.



  Note from another user:



  Shaw now also issues SMC PCI ethernet cards.  They give these out
  without boxes or manuals.  I found out that these are the SMC
  EtherPower PCI RJ45 card (model 8432T).  They use the DEC 21041 chip
  so the tulip ethernet driver is needed for it.



  If you need to set up your POP3 mailboxes you can do that at following
  URL:




  and you can login and setup the POP3 mailboxes that way.



  Oh, and for the record, Shaw's technical support is horrendous.  The
  best place to go for information is the athome.users-unix newsgroup
  (which is not even mentioned by any of the documentation) or please
  consult





  3.17.  Cogeco Cable, Canada


  This information is provided thanks to Terry O'Grady
  togrady@cgocable.net



  I have a Cable Modem through a company called Cogeco Cable located in
  various parts of Canada. They are part of the "Wave" system which
  includes Rogers Cable and Shaw Cable. The technical setup is different
  for each provider though. They supplied me with a D-Link ethernet card
  (the version of that has changed since then but I believe are still
  using D-Link) and a Zenith modem. The Ip setup is easy since they use
  DHCP so all I did was install the dhcp daemon
  (http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/DHCP.html) and that was that.
  If you like you can list my e-mail address togrady@cgocable.net for
  anyone with questions.


  3.18.  Optimum Online, New York and Connecticut

  (islesfan@nassau.cv.net):



  Optimum Online uses DHCP, and rrclientd in Linux, by John Clark.
  Check out for instructions on how to set up your service with Linux.



  Tell people who had private ips who have public ips now to change
  their /etc/resolv.conf to look like this...  domain nassau.cv.net (or
  optonline.net depenind on the users mood) nameserver 167.206.112.3
  nameserver 167.206.112.4 Other Than that its the same setup procedure
  note: the rrclientd software will work if you tell it dce-server and
  you specify the domain as optonline.net





  3.19.  Singapore Cable Vision, Singapore


  This information is provided by Jieyao (jieyao@letterbox.com):



  SCV provides Motorola Cybersurfer modem connected to the network card
  via UTP cable. The IP setup is easy since they use DHCP so all you
  need to do is install the dhcp daemon
  (http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/DHCP.html). If you can't make
  access the first time, turn the modem off then on again.


  3.20.  Cable Wanadoo, France


  This information is provided by Jerome SAUTRET
  (Jerome.Sautret@wanadoo.fr):



  I just read your  Cable Modem HOWTO. I live in France, and I use Cable
  Wanadoo, the cable service of France Telecom, which is the main
  telecom operator in France. It is available in a few cities in France
  at the moment, like Angers and Metz. This service provides a dynamic
  IP address via DHCP. It uses a COM 21 modem plugged in a 10BaseT
  Ethernet card.  The IP setup is easy just read the DHCP mini HOWTO
  (http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/DHCP.html).


  3.21.  Prime Cable Expressnet, Las Vegas, NV


  This information is provided by jedi jedi@penguin.lcvm.com:



  They use the Com21 which can either be connected directly to your
  10baseT input or inserted into the downlink input on your router.
  Static IPs are available for $10 per month and the usual address
  assignment is through DHCP (  )



  More information can be obtained from


  3.22.  TVD, Belgium


  This information is provided by  Pierre-Yves Keldermans
  pykeldermans@usa.net:



  At home, my cable-TV company is "TVD", it is the first company to
  offer internet on the cable in Belgium.



  Hardware : LanCity cable modem & 10-Base-T NIC ( DLink ISA if you buy
  it from TVD )



  Config : DHCP (  )



  Prices :




    Cheap : for home use, real IP address but dynamic, DHCP expires
     every 10 min, 1 user only (theorically ... ), no problem with
     firewall, the web server on my computer is even reachable from
     outside..., full speed FROM internet, small speed TO internet.

    No so cheap : for small office use, same as 1) but not limited to 1
     user and more speed TO internet.

    Expensive : for WWW servers & ... , Static IP addresses and
     reserved bandwidth TO internet following price.



  Speed :

  >From TVD's mirror site : up to 250Kbytes/sec, very nice ( and YES,
  they have some Linux mirrors like redhat ... :-) ) >From internet :
  variable but rather good if the remote server isn't overloaded.

  4.  Hybrid Cable modem ISPs


  If you think you have the card recognized you have to now look at the
  entry for your ISP. I have sorted the information according to a
  provider because setups are mostly ISP specific.



  This section is for people who are using so-called "hybrid" cable
  modems. Hybrid modems are those that need two kinds of connections,
  one to the (TV) cable and one to the phone line.


  4.1.  Adelphia Powerlink


  Check out the following URL for directions on how to set up Linux with
  Powerlink


  4.2.  LinkExpress, Brasil


  This information is provided by Rodrigo Severo (rodrigo@who.net):



  First of all, let me tell you that here we have the MMD Cable Modem
  from General Instrument. We use SurfBoard 1000 ISA board for download
  and a regular telephone modem for upload. I would prefer to use an
  external board like the SurfBoard 1200 which is available only to
  corporate users, i.e., willing to pay US$ 200,00 instead of the
  regular US$ 30,00 so I found out this driver for the internal ISA
  board.



  I started from the files I downloaded from .



  Here is the relevant data:


  ______________________________________________________________________
      ISP: LinkExpress <http://www.linkexpress.com.br>
      DNS: 200.252.88.20
      Frequency: 351 MHz
      Phone number: 321 3300
  ______________________________________________________________________




  During a download from a local tucows mirror I got 70KB 300KB per
  second. From distant sites I managed to get 30KB/s a few times.

  4.3.  ExpressNet, Maryland


  I recently accuired an expressnet cable modem for the maryland area.
  it is a  com21 one way modem and I had a hell a time making it work so
  id like to share my knowledge in your faq maybe? well heres what I
  learned inorder for the PPP connection to authenticate the user must
  be running PAP which consists of editing the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file
  accordingly




  ______________________________________________________________________
  #/etc/ppp/pap-secrets
  #this is the PAP secrets file for PPP
  #the quotes are required on both
  "username"      *       "password"
  ______________________________________________________________________



  after that they must create a PPP-on script what ever name it must
  execute this command




  ______________________________________________________________________
  exec /usr/sbin/pppd debug persist /dev/ttyS1 38400 0.0.0.0:0.0.0.0 connect "chat -v TIMEOUT 3 ABORT 'BUSY' ABORT 'NOANSWER' '' ATH TIMEOUT 30 'OK' ATDTTELEPHONE CONNECT ''"
  ______________________________________________________________________



  this must be done with no carrage returns either



  next step is to modify the /etc/ppp/ip-up.local file if it does not
  exist it should be created it should read the following





  ______________________________________________________________________
  #!/bin/bash
  #/etc/ppp/ip-up.local
  #this will set up the route to the ppp device as default everytime the modem
  #authenticates dont include it if you do not want this option
  route add default ppp0
  ______________________________________________________________________



  then the user must configure their ethernet card on box I have a 3c905

  I configured it the following way


  ______________________________________________________________________
  ifconfig eth0 up
  ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1 broadcast 10.0.0.15 netmask 255.255.255.240
  ______________________________________________________________________



  then I added some more routes to the kernel routing table as follows


  ______________________________________________________________________
  route add -host 10.0.0.1 eth0
  route add -net 10.0.0.0 eth0
  ______________________________________________________________________





  all of these commands can be added into a script file as follows




  ______________________________________________________________________
  #!/bin/bash
  #This is a script file for establishing the cable modem IF device properties as
  #well as the route properties
  ifconfig eth0 up
  ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1 broadcast 10.0.0.15 netmask 255.255.255.240
  route add -host 10.0.0.1 eth0
  route add -net 10.0.0.0 eth0
  ______________________________________________________________________



  thats all and the cable modem connection is setup fast as hell I might
  add.
