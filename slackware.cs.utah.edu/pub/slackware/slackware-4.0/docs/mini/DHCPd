Linux DHCPD mini-HOWTO 
by Paul Makeev <mac@RoSprint.net>
v1.2, 24 June 1997


1. Introduction

   DHCP is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is used to control
vital networking parameters of hosts (running clients) with the help
of server (running, suprise!, server daemon). DHCP is backward compatible
with BOOTP. For more information see RFC 2131 (old RFC 1531) and other.
(See Internet Resources section at the end of the document).

   This mini-HOWTO is about DHCP _SERVER_ daemon. There is DHCP _client_ daemon 
for Linux, which is not described here. You can find _client_ package at:

Primary-site:   ftp.kobe-u.ac.jp /pub/PC-UNIX/Linux/network/dhcp
                32kB dhcpcd-0.65.tar.gz
Alternate-site: sunsite.unc.edu /pub/Linux/system/network/daemons
                32kB dhcpcd-0.65.tar.gz

2. DHCPD server for Linux.

   There is several DHCP servers available for U*X-like OSes, both commercial
and free. I have success with Paul Vixie/ISC DHCPD. I used Beta-5.0.9, and now 
use 5.0.14. These are both not Linux-specific versions, but they flawlessly 
compile and work (not so flawlessly). You can get latest software at:

http://www.isc.org/dhcp/dhcp-beta.html (It is not updated yet, however)

or, the latest version for now:

ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/dhcp/DHCPD-BETA-5.16.tar.gz 

 There is no distributions of DHCP on ftp.vix.com now. They are moved to
ftp.isc.org.


NB!!! READ CAREFULY the README file before compiling and installing. It contains
Linux-specific info.

3. Kernel configuration.

   You should have MULTICAST enabled in kernel. Of course, TCP/IP
networking should be enabled also :-)

4. Configuration.


   ifconfig -a should say smth like:

eth0      Link encap:10Mbps Ethernet  HWaddr 00:C0:4F:D3:C4:62
          inet addr:183.217.19.43  Bcast:183.217.19.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:2875542 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0
          TX packets:218647 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0
          Interrupt:11 Base address:0x210 

If there is no "MULTICAST" letters, you should reconfigure your kernel to
add multicast support (and reboot, of course). You don't need to do 
anything else to enable multicasting.

   You should have "netstat -rn" saying:

dhcps:~$ netstat -rn
Kernel routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref Use    Iface
255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0      101 eth0

  i.e., you should have multicast routing to your ethernet interface.

5. Problems with multicast.

   If your "route add -host 255.255.255.255 eth0" command says smth like
"255.255.255.255: Unknown host", try adding host with this address to
/etc/hosts file, and issue "route add -host hostname eth0" instead. It should
work. If not, get newer Networking utils and/or upgrade kernel version.

6. DHCPD configuration.

   Read the included docs. It's too complicated to discuss here.

7. Can i run DHCPD on machine with two or more Ethercards?

According to dhcpd mailing list, newest stable kernal, 2.0.31 could
work with newest version of DHCPD (5.0.15) to support more than one
interface. According to dhcp-server mailing list, Linux 2.0.31 have
SO_BINDTODEVICE code, which makes it possible to distinguish raw interfaces,
thus newer DHCPD could work on two interfaces in Linux. This feature,
however, is _extremely BETA_. I didn't check it yet, but will do it 
and place success information into next version of howto.

PLEASE! Don't ask me where to get kernel 2.0.31. It is unofficial
pre-patch at the time this document was created.

8. Dynamic DNS.

There is a proposed DNS and DHCP server integration mechanisms to
enable dynamic DNS. You can read RFC 2136 and 2137. Several DHCP and
DNS servers could have proprietary mechanisms to update DNS information.
BIND v.8, which supports dynamic updates, is developed by ISC also,
and i hope DHCPD and BIND would be integrated in short time.

     BIND v.8 URL: http://www.isc.org/bind.html.

I wrote a Python program, which automates adding host to DHCP and DNS
tables. If you want more info on it, write me (mac@rosprint.net). It is
not RFC-compliant, but does dirty work.
   

9. Internet Resources:

ISC DHCP home page. You can get a lot of information here.
This is my favorite site.
