The file X11R6/lib/X11/doc/VideoModes.doc explains how to setup video
timings for your video card / monitor combination, however I found
this to be a long overly complicated explanation of something really
not that complex.  Please let no one take offense at this, since
without this file I don't think I would ever have figured out how to
configure my setup and I am therefore very thankful to the writers of
that document. I just thought I would give my shortened explanation of
how to setup your XF86Config file for XFree86 and in particular
information about the Mach64 timings I've played with.

There are three major sections of the XF86Config file that deal with
the video card and monitor: the monitor section, the graphics device
section and the screen section. Ironically the timings I'm discussing
in this document concentrate on Monitor section even though I use
many specs from the video card.

In regard to the graphics device section I suggest commenting out any
"Clocks" given in the file when setting up a new server and/or video
card and let "X -probeonly" determine what Clocks are good for your
card / server combination.  I recommend this above just putting in the
numbers given in the manual because exact timings on cards will vary.
Redirect this information into a file and copy it into the XF86Config
file.

Now the hard part about setting up a XF86Config file is the
definitions of the Modelines.  For many non-ATI cards these number must
be multiples of 8.  For ATI cards they need NOT be.  There are 10
arguments after each Modeline directive:

Modeline <name> <DCL> <HR> <HPS> <HPE> <HFL> <VR> <VPS> <VPE> <VFL>

 (name) Any name you'd like to assign to this mode, in double quotes.
        The most common name is of the form HRxVR (e.g. "640x480")
        However if you would like to have multiple Dot Clocks for a
        give resolution setting your might try HRxVRxDCL
        (e.g. "640x480x35.0")

 (DCL) Dot Clock: This should be one of the dot clocks listed in the
	manual or found in the Clocks section from the "X -probeonly"
	command. 

 (HR & VR) Horizontal and Vertical Resolution: This also an easy one, it's
           the number pixels you want to see across and down the
           screen when you're in this mode.

 (HPS, HPE, VPS, VPE) Hortz. & Vertical Pulse Start and End: This
           controls where the image of the screen will be placed
           relative to the physical screen.  These are the numbers to
           play with if the image is biased toward the edges of the
           physical screen.  For starters just make them evenly spaced
           between the resolution numbers (HR,VR) and the field length
           numbers (HFL,VFL). 
           If the image is biased toward the left (right), increase
           (decrease) the HPS and the HPE.
           If the image is biased toward the top (bottom), increase
           (decrease) the HPS and the HPE.

 (HFL,VFL) Horizontal & Vertical Field Length: Now these are the most
           important numbers of all.  If you set these numbers too
           low or high for your monitor the XF86 server will reject
           your whole modeline.  The KEY relation to remember is:

              ---------------------------------------------
	      | DCL = HSF * HFL  and DCL = RR * VFL * HFL |
              ---------------------------------------------
           
	   where HSF = Horiz. Scan Freq.   (kHz)
                 RR  = (Vert.) Refresh Rate (Hz)

These two numbers are given as a valid range for a particular monitor.
Try exceeding the specs and see how far you can go before funny
things start happening.

These two equations give you all the information you need to set up
your Modelines for a particular set-up.  They leave two degrees of
freedom (i.e. two unknowns), for a chosen Dot Clock (DCL).  As HFL and
VFL get smaller, the screen will get wider and taller.  However, you
can not make these values arbitrarily close to the HR and VR since as
they approach these values the HSF and RR will exceed your monitor's
cabilities.  Therefore one way of getting the maximum image size
(hence using the most of your physical monitor's real-estate) for a
particular Dot Clock (DCL) is to plug in the maximum HSF and RR your
monitor is rated for.  If the image is still too small your only option is
to reduce the Dot Clock (DCL) (or try exceeding your monitor specs).
This fact troubled me for sometime as it seems counter-intuitive,
however try to get comfortable with it as it is true none-the-less.

The other way I thought of to resolve the extra degrees of freedom is
to use the video card table given in the manual of my Mach 64.  The
manual gave DCL, HSF, & RR, hence I could solve for VFL & HFL using
the equations above. I thought this might be a good idea since perhaps
in some way the card was "designed" to work at these frequencies, and
hence they make work better in some way. (However, I now seriously
doubt that assumption.) Here is that table:
