  Locales mini-HOWTO

  v1.5, 21 July 1997

  This document describes how to set up your Linux machine to use
  locales.

  1.  Introduction

  This is really a description of what I had to do to get localedef
  installed, compile some locales, and try them out.  I did this just
  for fun, and thought that perhaps some people would be interested in
  trying it out themselves.  Once it is set up you should be able to use
  NLS enabled applications with the locale of your choice.  After a
  while, locale support should be part of the standard distributions,
  and most of this mini-HOWTO will be redundant.

  2.  What is a "locale" anyhow?

  Locales encapsulate some of the language/culture specific things that
  you shouldn't hard code in your programs.

  If you have various locales installed on your computer then you can
  select via the following list of environment variables how a locale
  sensitive program will behave.  The default locale is the C, or POSIX
  locale which is hard coded in libc.

     LANG
        This sets the locale, but can be overridden with any other
        LC_xxxx environment variables

     LC_COLLATE
        Sort order.

     LC_CTYPE
        Character definitions, uppercase, lowercase, ...  These are used
        by the functions like toupper, tolower, islower, isdigit, ...

     LC_MONETARY
        Contains the information necessary to format money in the
        fashion expected.  It has the definitions of things like the
        thousands separator, decimal separator, and what the monetary
        symbol is and how to position it.

     LC_NUMERIC
        Thousands, and decimal separators, and the numeric grouping
        expected.

     LC_TIME
        How to specify the time, and date.  This has the things like the
        days of the week, and months of the year in abbreviated, and non
        abbreviated form.

     LC_MESSAGES
        Yes, and No expressions.

     LC_ALL
        This sets the locale, and overrides any other LC_xxxx
        environment variables.

  Here are some other locales, and there are lots more.

     en_CA
        English Canadian.

     en_US
        US English.

     de_DE
        Germany's German.

     fr_FR
        France's French.

  If you are writing a program, and want to to be usable internationally
  you should utilize locales.  The most glaring reason for this is that
  not everybody is going to use the same character set/code page as you.

  Make sure in your programs that you don't do things like:

       /* check for alphabetic characters */
       if ( (( c >= 'a') && ( c <= 'z' )) ||
            (( c >= 'A') && ( c <= 'Z' )) ) { ... }

  If you write that type of code your program assumes that the
  user/file/... is ASCII and nothing but ASCII, and it does not respect
  the code page definitions of the user's locale.  For example it
  preludes characters such as a-umelaut which would be used in a German
  environment.  What you should do instead is use the locale sensitive
  functions like isalpha().  If your program does expliticly require use
  of only US-ASCII alphabetics, you still use the isalpha() function,
  but you must also either do setlocale(LC_CTYPE,"C") or set the LANG,
  LC_CTYPE, or LC_ALL environment variables to "C".

  Locales allow a large degree of flexibility and make certain
  assumptions that a programmer may have made in ASCII based C programs
  invalid.

  For instance, you cannot assume the code positions of characters.
  There is nothing stopping you from creating a charmap file that
  defines the code position of 'A' to be 0xC1 rather than 0x41.  This is
  in fact the code point mapping for 'A' in IBM code page 37, used on
  mainframes, while the former is used for US-ASCII, iso8859-x, and
  others.

  The basic idea is different people speak different languages, expect
  different sorting orders, use different code pages, and live in
  different countries.  Locales and locale sensitive programs give one a
  means to respect such things, and handle them accordingly.  It is not
  really much extra work to do so, it just requires a slightly different
  frame of mind when writing programs.

  3.  Notes.

  ·  In order to set up locales on my machine I had to upgrade a few
     things.  Apparently ftp.tu-clausthal.de:/pub/linux/SLT/nls contains
     a a.out version of locale and localedef (in the file
     nlsutils-0.5.tar.gz), so if you don't have an ELF system, or don't
     want one you can use the above.  There is probably a copy of the
     nlsutils package some other place, but I have not looked for it.  I
     hadn't known that there was a stand alone version of locale and
     localedef, and kind of figured that you would have to have the
     corresponding libc installed.  Because of this a lot of this HOWTO
     is just a log of what I had to do to upgrade libc and family.  If
     you do this, as I have you, will need to be running an ELF system,
     or upgrade to one as you set up your locales.

  ·  The sorts of system upgrades that I did are the same sort of
     upgrades that have to be done to upgrade from a.out to ELF.  If you
     haven't done this, or if you have upgraded to ELF by reinstalling
     Linux then you should get the resent ELF HOWTO from a sunsite
     mirror.  This is an excellent guide, and gives additional guidance
     for installing libc, ld.so, and other ELF system upgrades.

  ·  For anything that you install, read the appropriate release notes,
     or README type files.  If you mess up your system by
     misinterpreting something that I say here, or ( hopefully not ) by
     doing something that I say in here, please don't blame me.

  ·  Mis-installing a new libc, and ld.so, could leave you with an
     unbootable system.  You probably ought to have a boot disk handy,
     and make sure any critical, non-replaceable, data is backed up.

  4.  What you need.

  A few things need to be down loaded from various places.  Everything
  here except for the locale source files can be obtained from
  sunsite.unc.edu, tsx-11.mit.edu, or, preferably, a local mirror of
  these sites.  When I did this originally I used libc-5.2.18, which is
  now quite out of date.  As of now I have been told that the current
  libc is 5.4.17, and this substitution has been made below.  However,
  libc 5.4.17, will likely be old before you can blink, so just use the
  lastest version when you do this.

  You may want to consider using glibc (gnu libc) rather than Linux libc
  5 for any internationalization work.  As of now glibc 2.0.4 (gnu libc)
  is available but no distributions have started using it as the
  standard libc yet (at least for Intel based Linux distributions).  As
  well as being fully reentrant and having built in threading support,
  glibc is fully internationalized and has excellent
  internationalization support for programming.  What
  internationalization has been done in libc 5 has been mostly taken
  from glibc.  The locales and charmaps for glibc are bundled with the
  the glibc locale add on.

  If you opt for using glibc then you can ignore this mini-howto.
  Including the locale add on in the glibc compilation and installation
  is trivial, and is covered in the glibc installation documentation.
  Be warned that a full upgrade is not a trivial job!  I am hoping that
  redhat (which I use) will have a glibc based release soon, as I am not
  inclined to recompile my entire system.

  ·  locale, and charmap sources --- These are what you compile using
     localedef.

  ·  libc-5.4.17.bin.tar.gz --- the ELF shared libraries for the c and
     math libraries.  Note that the precompiled program localedef for
     libc.5.4.17 is apparently corrupt and creates LC_CTYPE with invalid
     magic number.  This probably means that an older localedef got into
     the binary distribution.

  ·  libc-5.4.17.tar.gz --- the source code for the ELF shared
     libraries.  You may need this to compile localedef.

  ·  make-3.74.tar.gz --- you may need to compile make to incorporate a
     patch to fix the dirent bug.

  ·  release.libc-5.2.18 --- these release notes have the patch to make
     make.  it's been a while since this make bug happened, and it is
     likely that you don't have to worry about it.

  ·  ld.so-1.7.12+ --- the dynamic linker.

  ·  ELF gcc-2.7.2+ --- to compile things.

  ·  an ELF kernel ( eg. 2.0.xx )  --- to compile things.

  ·  binutils 2.6.0.2+ --- to compile things.

  There are probably lots of places that you can get locale sources.  I
  have found public domain locale and charmap sources at
  dkuug.dk:/i18n/WG15-collection/locales
  <ftp://dkuug.dk/i18n/WG15-collection/locales> and
  dkuug.dk:/i18n/WG15-collection/charmaps
  <ftp://dkuug.dk/i18n/WG15-collection/charmaps>  respectively.

  5.  Installing everything.

  This is what I did to install everything.  I already had an ELF system
  ( compiler, kernel, ... ) installed before I did this.

  1. First I installed the binutils package.  tar xzf
     binutils-2.6.0.2.bin.tar.gz -C /

  2. Next I installed the dynamic linker:

       tar zxf ld.so-1.7.12.tar.gz -C /usr/src
       cd /usr/src/ld.so-1.7.12
       sh instldso.sh

  3. Next I installed the libc binaries.  See release.libc-5.4.17 for
     more instructions.

       rm -f /usr/lib/libc.so /usr/lib/libm.so
       rm -f /usr/include/iolibio.h /usr/include/iostdio.h
       rm -f /usr/include/ld_so_config.h /usr/include/localeinfo.h
       rm -rf /usr/include/netinet /usr/include/net /usr/include/pthread
       tar -xzf libc-5.4.17.bin.tar.gz -C /

  4. Now ldconfig must be run to locate the new shared libraries.
     ldconfig -v.

  5. There is a bug that was fixed in libc that breaks make, and some
     other programs.  Here is what I did in order to rebuild and install
     make.

       tar zxf make-3.74.tar.gz -C /usr/src
       cd /usr/src/make-3.74
       patch < /whereever_you_put_it/release.libc-5.4.17
       configure --prefix=/usr
       sh build.sh
        ./make install
       cd ..
       rm -rf make-2.74

  6. Now localedef can be compiled and installed.

       mkdir /usr/src/libc
       tar zxf libc-5.4.17.tar.gz -C /usr/src/libc
       cd /usr/src/libc
       cd include
       ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/asm .
       ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/linux .
       cd ../libc
        ./configure
       # I am not sure if these two makes are necessary, but just to be safe :
       make clean ; make depend
       cd locale
       make programs
       mv localedef /usr/local/bin
       mv locale /usr/local/bin

  7. Put the charmaps where localedef will find them.  This uses the
     charmaps and locale sources which I down loaded from dkuug.dk ftp
     site as charmaps.tar, and locales.tar respectively.  The older
     localedef (5.2.18) looked in /usr/share/nls/charmap for charmap
     sources, but now localedef looks in /usr/share/i18n/charmaps and
     /usr/share/i18n/locales by default for the charmap and locale
     sources:

       mkdir /usr/share/i18n
       mkdir /usr/share/i18n/charmaps
       mkdir /usr/share/i18n/locales
       tar xf charmaps.tar -C /usr/share/i18n/charmaps
       tar xf locales.tar -C /usr/share/i18n/locales

  The newer localedef (5.4.17) has been made smarter and will look for
  other locale source files when handling the `copy' statement, whereas
  the older localedef needed to have the locale objects already created
  in order to handle the copy statement.  This list of commands has the
  dependencies sorted out and can be used to generate all the locale
  objects regardless of which libc version is being used, but you should
  now be able to create only the ones that you wish.

       localedef -ci en_DK -f ISO_8859-1:1987 en_DK
       localedef -ci sv_SE -f ISO_8859-1:1987 sv_SE

       localedef -ci de_DE -f ISO_8859-1:1987 de_DE
       localedef -ci de_CH -f ISO_8859-1:1987 de_CH
       localedef -ci fr_CH -f ISO_8859-1:1987 fr_CH
       localedef -ci en_CA -f ISO_8859-1:1987 en_CA
       localedef -ci fr_CA -f ISO_8859-1:1987 fr_CA
       localedef -ci fo_FO -f ISO_8859-1:1987 fo_FO
       localedef -ci et_EE -f ISO_8859-1:1987 et_EE
       localedef -ci es_ES -f ISO_8859-1:1987 es_ES
       localedef -ci en_US -f ISO_8859-1:1987 en_US
       localedef -ci en_GB -f ISO_8859-1:1987 en_GB
       localedef -ci en_IE -f ISO_8859-1:1987 en_IE
       localedef -ci de_LU -f ISO_8859-1:1987 de_LU
       localedef -ci de_BE -f ISO_8859-1:1987 de_BE
       localedef -ci de_AT -f ISO_8859-1:1987 de_AT
       localedef -ci sl_SI -f ISO_8859-2:1987 sl_SI
       localedef -ci ru_RU -f ISO_8859-5:1988 ru_RU
       localedef -ci pl_PL -f ISO_8859-2:1987 pl_PL
       localedef -ci lv_LV -f BALTIC lv_LV
       localedef -ci lt_LT -f BALTIC lt_LT
       localedef -ci iw_IL -f ISO_8859-8:1988 iw_IL
       localedef -ci hu_HU -f ISO_8859-2:1987 hu_HU
       localedef -ci hr_HR -f ISO_8859-4:1988 hr_HR
       localedef -ci gr_GR -f ISO_8859-7:1987 gr_GR

  6.  Now what.

  After doing all the stuff above you should now be able to use the
  locales that have been created.  Here is a simple example program.

  /* test.c : a simple test to see if the locales can be loaded, and
   * used */
  #include <locale.h>
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <time.h>

  main(){
   time_t t;
   struct tm * _t;
   char buf[256];

   time(&t);
   _t = gmtime(&t);

   setlocale(LC_TIME,"");
   strftime(buf,256,"%c",_t);

   printf("%s\n",buf);
  }

  You can use the locale program to see what your current locale
  environment variable settings are.

       $ # compile the simple test program above, and run it with
       $ # some different locale settings
       $ gcc -s -o Test test.c
       $ # see what the current locale is :
       $ locale
       LANG=POSIX
       LC_COLLATE="POSIX"
       LC_CTYPE="POSIX"
       LC_MONETARY="POSIX"
       LC_NUMERIC="POSIX"
       LC_TIME="POSIX"
       LC_MESSAGES="POSIX"
       LC_ALL=
       $ # Ho, hum... we're using the boring C locale
       $ # let's change to English Canadian:
       $ export LC_TIME=en_CA
       $ Test
       Sat 23 Mar 1996 07:51:49 PM
       $ # let's try French Canadian:
       $ export LC_TIME=fr_CA
       $ Test
       sam 23 mar 1996 19:55:27

  7.  catopen bug fix.

  Installing the locales fixes a bug (feature ?)  that is in the catopen
  command in Linux libc.  Say you create a program that uses message
  catalogs, and you create an German catalog and put it in
  /home/peeter/catalogs/de_DE.

  Now upon doing the following, without the de_DE locale installed :

  export LC_MESSAGES=de_DE
  export NLSPATH=/home/peeter/catalogs/%L/%N.cat:$NLSPATH

  the German message catalog does not get opened, and the default mes­
  sages in the catgets calls are used.

  This is because catopen does a setlocale call to get the right message
  category, the setlocale fails even though the environment variable has
  been set.  catopen then attempts to load the message catalog
  substituting "C" for all the "%L"'s in the NLSPATH.

  You can still use your message catalog without installing the locale,
  but you would have to explicitly set the "%L" part of the NLSPATH like

       export NLSPATH=/home/peeter/catalogs/de_DE/%N.cat:$NLSPATH

  , but this defeats the whole purpose of the locale catagory environ­
  ment variables.

  8.  Questions and Answers.

  This section could grow into a FAQ, but isn't really one yet.

  8.1.  msgcat question

  I am an user of LINUX, and have written the following test program:

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <locale.h>
       #include <features.h>
       #include <nl_types.h>

       main(int argc, char ** argv)
       {
        nl_catd catd;

        setlocale(LC_MESSAGES, "");
        catd = catopen("msg", MCLoadBySet);
        fprintf(stderr,catgets(catd, 1, 1, "locale message fail\n"));
        catclose(catd);
       }
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       $ msg.m
       $set 1

       1 locale message pass\n
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

  If I use absolute path in catopen like
  catopen("/etc/locale/msg.cat",MCLoadBySet); ,I got the right result.
  But,if I use above example,catopen return -1 (failure).

  8.2.  msgcat answer

  This question is sort of answered in the previous section, but here is
  some additional information.

  There are a number of valid places where you can put your message
  catalogs.  Even though you may not have NLSPATH explicitly defined in
  your environment settings it is defined in libc as follows :

       $ strings /lib/libc.so.5.4.17 | grep locale | grep %L
       /etc/locale/%L/%N.cat:/usr/lib/locale/%L/%N.cat:/usr
       /lib/locale/%N/%L:/usr/share/locale/%L/%N.cat:/usr/
       local/share/locale/%L/%N.cat

  so you if you have done one of :

       $ export LC_MESSAGES=en_CA
       $ export LC_ALL=en_CA
       $ export LANG=en_CA

  With the NLSPATH above and the specified environment , the
  catopen("msg", MCLoadBySet); should work if your message catalog has
  been copied to any one of :

       /etc/locale/en_CA/msg.cat
       /usr/lib/locale/en_CA/msg.cat
       /usr/lib/locale/msg/en_CA
       /usr/share/locale/en_CA/msg.cat
       /usr/local/share/locale/en_CA/msg.cat

  This, however, will not work if you don't have the en_CA locale
  installed because the setlocale will fail, and "C" will be substituted
  for "%L" in the catopen routine ( rather than "en_CA" ).

  9.  More information.

  Well that's it.  Hopefully this guide has been some help to you.
  There are probably lots of places that you can look for additional
  information on writing locale sensitive programs, and documents on
  internationalization, and localization in general.  I'll bet that if
  you browse the web a bit you will be able to find a lot of info.
  Ulrich Drepper who implemented much of the gnu internationalization
  code has some information about internationalization and localization
  on his home page <http://i44www.info.uni-karlsruhe.de/~drepper>, and
  you can look there to start.  There is also some information in the
  info pages for libc, and of course, there are always man pages.
