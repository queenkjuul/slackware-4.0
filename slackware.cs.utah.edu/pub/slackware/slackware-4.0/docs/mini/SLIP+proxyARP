0. Introduction

In late 1994 and much of 1995, I had a small Ethernet LAN at home that 
I connected to the Internet.  At the time, I did not have my own 
network address and I wanted to piggyback on my employer's network 
address.  I succeeded using SLIP and proxy ARP.  This document quickly 
describes how I did it at the time.  It also provides information on 
other options available now that were not there in 1993/1994.  More 
than likely, these other options will be your best bet.  But, I'm 
continuing to maintain this document for those who need this type of 
solution.  

---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Other Options Available

When I originally wrote this mini-HOWTO, the options to connect via a 
dial-up LAN were more limited than today.  If you want to connect a 
local LAN to the Internet via a dial-up connection, you should look 
at:  

    IP Masquerade
        http://www.hwy401.com/achau/ipmasq/
        http://www.indyramp.com/masq/

    Use of proxy services
        http://harvest.transarc.com/afs/transarc.com/public/trg/Harvest/
        http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/

All links are current as of the date of this document.  I no longer
use this technique; if I had the same requirements today, I would
use IP Masquerade.

---------------------------------------------------------------

2. The Final Result

First, I'll present the final result and then describe how to get there.

The final network is all on a Class C network (a.b.c.0):

           Internet
              |               
      o-------+---------+----------------o     <- Remote Ethernet
                        | .126
                    NetBlazer
                        | .215                 <- SLIP (via 14.4 modem)
                       gw
                        | .253
      o-----------------+--------+-------o     <- Local Ethernet
                                 | .254 
                                mus

---------------------------------------------------------------

3. Setting It Up

The keys to getting this working are routing and proxy ARP.

Here is gw's routing table:

Kernel routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
    a.b.c.254   *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0     5628 eth0
    a.b.c.253   *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 eth0
    a.b.c.126   *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0       22 sl0
127.0.0.0       *               255.0.0.0       U     0      0       32 lo
default             a.b.c.126   *               UG    0      0        9 sl0

This table was created with the following commands:

    1. The SLIP connection was established which created the default
       gateway entry and the a.b.c.126 entry.

    2. ifconfig eth0 a.b.c.253

    3. route add a.b.c.253 eth0

    4. route add a.b.c.254 eth0

Gw is now set up to talk to both eth0 and sl0.  (This might be a good
time to note that my kernel has IP forwarding configured.)  The reason for
the explicit route of a.b.c.253 may not be needed, but ping .253 from .253
without the route causes the ping to take the default route out the SLIP
link.


Here is mus's routing table:

Kernel routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags MSS    Window Use Iface
    a.b.c.253   *               255.255.255.255 UH    1436   0       59 eth0
127.0.0.0       *               255.0.0.0       U     1936   0       52 lo
default             a.b.c.253   *               UG    1436   0    21661 eth0

This table was created with the following commands:

    1. ifconfig eth0 a.b.c.254

    2. route add a.b.c.253 eth0

    3. route add default gw 192.68.22.253

Now, at this point I attempted to ping the NetBlazer.  I could see the
packets being sent out the modem (SD was flashing), but there was no
response.  This was good since it indicated that gw was getting packets
in on eth0 (Ethernet) and sending them out sl0 (SLIP).

The next step is to get the other side of the SLIP connection (NetBlazer)
to recognize and know how to talk to me.  This was done by using its
proxy arp command.

    Usage: proxy <hostid> ether|token|<interface> <mac-addr>

    proxy a.b.c.253 ether 00:c0:6d:11:66:d3
    proxy a.b.c.254 ether 00:c0:6d:11:66:e4

At this point I was able to ping the Internet from mus.  And all was well
with the world.  :)

NOTE: The 'proxy' command is available only on the NetBlazer.  The
equivalent command under linux is 'arp -s <IP> <HW ADDR> pub'.

---------------------------------------------------------------

4. Kernel And Software

The kernel used on gw was 1.1.88 with IP Forwarding configured.  This
is required.  The kernel on mus was also 1.1.88, but IP Forwarding
was not configured.  This does not matter.

It's also worth noting that PPP could have been used instead of
SLIP just as easily.  [See, I told you this was a long time ago!]

---------------------------------------------------------------

5. Outstanding Issues And Questions

The main question I have came up while writing this.  When I checked 
the ARP table on the NetBlazer, my ARP entries were no longer there, but
everything was still working.  I readded the entry for mus and it made
no difference.  If anyone has ideas on this, let me know.

6. Acknowledgments

My thanks to John Garnett <garnett@actlab.rtf.utexas.edu> for his
post Dec 21, 1994 "A Guide on Using SLIP with ProxyARP..."  I'm not
so sure that my document is anything more than a rehash of what he
wrote other than I'm using a NetBlazer on the Internet side and he
had a modem attached to a computer.  Anyway, thanks, John!
