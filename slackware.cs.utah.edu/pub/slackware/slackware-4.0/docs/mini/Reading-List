The Linux Bibliography
By Jim Haynes <haynes@cats.ucsc.edu>

The following is not meant to be a comprehensive Unix
bibliography.  For that, see the Unix book list posted periodically
to misc.books.technical and to several comp.unix newsgroups.  This
list is meant to be supplemental, containing items of special interest
and importance for Linux workers (or 386BSD people - whatever turns you on).

Comments not in quotes below are mine.  Comments sent in by others are
in quotes, and have the name of the commentor in square brackets.
[except when they don't.  Some comments in quotes are from the publisher's
catalog.]

Please send additions, corrections, and comments to haynes@cats.ucsc.edu.

I. Hardware

   Upgrading and Repairing PCs; Mueller, Scott; Que Corp.; ISBN 0-88022-856-3;
   1298pp; 1992; $34.95 (USA).  This is a book I bought when I was struggling
   with an AT-clone.  It is best on XTs and ATs and IBM PS/2s.  Still, there
   is a wealth of information common to all models.  EISA and VESA are
   mentioned only in the glossary.

   80386 Hardware Reference Manual; Intel Corp.; ISBN 1-55512-024-5; ?pp.;
   1986; $?.  Pin connections, timing, waveforms, block diagrams, voltages,
   all that kind of stuff.

   The Indispensable PC Hardware Book; Messmer, Hans-Peter; Addison-
   Wesley; ISBN 0-201-62424-9; 1000 pp; 1993.  Covers the more recent
   stuff like EIDE and PCI.

II. Processor architecture and programming

    80386 Programmer's Reference Manual; Intel Corp.; ISBN 1-55512-022-9;
    ?pp.; 1986; $?.  Part I. Applications Programming, data types, memory
    model, instruction set.  Part II. Systems Programming, architecture,
    memory management, protection, multitasking, I/O, exceptions and
    interrupts, initialization, coprocessing and multiprocessing. Part III.
    Compatibility (with earlier x86 machines).  Part IV. Instruction Set.

    80386 System Software Writer's Guide; Intel Corp.; ISBN 1-55512-023-7;
    ?pp.; 1987; $?.  This explains the 386 features for operating system
    writers.  It includes a chapter on Unix implementation.  A lot of the
    80386 architecture seems to have been designed with Multics in mind;
    the features are not used by DOS or by Unix.

    Programming the 80386; Crawford, John H., and Gelsinger, Patrick P.;
    Sybex; ISBN 0-89588-381-3; 774pp.; $26.95 (USA).  This is the book the
    Jolitzes used when they ported BSD to the 386 architecture.

    Pentium Processor User's Manual: Volume 3, Architecture and Programming
    Manual; Intel Corp.; ISBN 1-55512-195-0; ?pp.; 1993; $?.  Pretty much
    the Pentium version of the 80386 Programmer's manual listed above.


III. Unix Kernel Implementation

     The Design of the Unix Operating System; Bach, Maurice J.; Prentice-
     Hall; ISBN 0-13-201799-7; 470pp.; $60 (USA).  The book that got Linus
     started.

     The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD Unix Operating System;
     Leffler, Samuel J., McKusick, Marshall Kirk, Karels, Michael J., and
     Quarterman, John S.; Addison-Wesley; ISBN 0-201-06196-1; 471 pp.;
     1989, 1990; $44.95 (USA).  So, it's not about Linux, but can you
     afford to ignore it?

     Linux Kernel Hacker's Guide; Johnson, Michael K.; Linux Documentation
     Project; FTP sites (see end of document); 1993.

     Linux kernel programming; about six authors; Addison-Wesley.

     Operating Systems, Design and Implementation; Tanenbaum, Andrew S.;
     Prentice-Hall; 1987.  [sugg. by Alan Cox]

     Porting Unix to the 386; Jolitz, William F., and Jolitz, Lynne G.;
     Dr. Dobb's Journal; Jan 1991-July 1992.
     
IV. System Calls

    The Posix.1 Standard: A Programmer's Guide; Zlotnick, Fred; Benjamin/
    Cummings; ISBN 0-8053-9605-5; 379pp.; 1991; $35.95 (USA).  When I
    complained about the lack of Section 2 man pages in Linux, somebody
    told me just to get a POSIX book, because that's what Linux does.
    I like this book because I'm not a professional programmer and the
    author gives copious explanations and examples.  


V. Networking

   Unix Network Programming; Stevens, W. Richard; PTR Prentice Hall;
   ISBN 0-13-949876-1; 772 pp.; $54 (USA).  Everything you might want to
   know about the subject, and some things you probably don't want to
   know (really, XNS!?).

   in the latest release of BIND obsoletes some of this material.

    (The above is not meant as an advertisement or endorsement of a
    particular publication; it's just that I think it's pretty exciting
    that Linux has reached a level of popularity and maturity such that
    someone believes the market can support a magazine devoted to it.)

    i'x [a German magazine, focusing on multi-user, multi-tasking system,
    usually containing some artciles on Linux]

    For a while there was a LinuxNews electronically-published newsletter,
    but it seems to have ceased publication.

Finding Stuff On-Line:

    For people with ftp access to the Internet, the main Linux archive sites
    in the U.S. are sunsite.unc.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu.  The Linux
    Documentation Project work-in-progress is to be found in
    sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP   The file LDP-Manifesto describes
    the project.  Matt Welsh, mdw@sunsite.unc.edu is the contact person
    for LDP.

    The site appropriately named  rtfm.mit.edu  holds archives of FAQ
    (Frequently-Asked-Questions) and HOWTO files from just about every
    Usenet news group in existence.  From here you can obtain copies of
    the various Linux HOWTO files that are posted from time to time in
    newsgroups of the comp.os.linux hierarchy.

    For those without ftp access there are a number of BBSes containing
    information about Linux.  A list of these is posted from time to time
    on comp.os.linux.announce.

Off-Line:

    A number of software publishers are issuing Linux on CD-ROM.  Somebody
    tell me which if any of these are including documentation such as the
    LDP manuals on the CD.

    And then you can always buy one of the commercially-published books
    above and take it with you to the beach.  The idea for this list really
    originated with, "what can you buy at the local software emporium
    or book store when you need to learn something that you can't get
    from the on-line manual pages or from the net?"
