  2.  DHCP protocol


  DHCP is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is used to control
  vital networking parameters of hosts (running clients) with the help
  of a server. DHCP is backward compatible with BOOTP. For more
  information see RFC 2131 (old RFC 1531) and other. (See Internet
  Resources section at the end of the document). You can also read DHCP
  FAQ (http://web.syr.edu/ jmwobus/comfaqs/dhcp.faq.html).


  This mini-HOWTO covers both the DHCP _SERVER_ daemon as well as DHCP
  _CLIENT_ daemon. Most people need the client daemon which is used by
  workstations to obtain network information from a remote server. The
  server daemon is used by system administrators to distribute network
  information to clients so if you are just a regular user you need the
  _CLIENT_ daemon.


  3.  Client Setup

  3.1.  Downloading Client Daemon


  2.0.x kernels


  No matter what distribution you are using you will need to download
  the DHCP client daemon for Linux. The package you need to download is
  called dhcpcd and the current version is 0.70. You can read the
  description of the package here.
  (ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/daemons/dhcpcd-0.70.lsm)



  2.1.x kernels



  Due to changes in ipv4 network package in 2.1.x kernels (e.g. way it
  sets the defaults for several fields) dhcpcd doesn't work properly.
  Most users don't run experimental kernels so this shouldn't be a
  problem. If you do you should try dhcpcd 1.3.16  which is a modified
  version that has been written by Sergei Viznyuk  sergei@phystech.com
  in order to avoid mentioned problems. You can fetch it at:




  

  


  3.2.  Slackware


  You can download the latest copy of the DHCPcd from any Sunsite mirror
  or following:


  

  

     (Primary site in Japan)



  Download the latest version of dhcpcd.tar.gz


    Unpack it



     tar -zxvf dhcpcd-0.70.tar.gz


    cd into the directory and make dhcpcd


     cd dhcpcd-0.70

     make


    Install it (you have to run the following command as root)


     make install


  This will create the directory /etc/dhcpc where DHCPcd will store the
  DHCP information and dhcpcd file will be copied into /usr/sbin.

  In order to make the system initialize using DHCP during boot type:

  cd /etc/rc.d

  mv rc.inet1 rc.inet1.OLD


  This will move the old network initialization script into
  rc.inet1.OLD.  You now need to create the new rc.inet1 script.
  Following code is all you need:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  #!/bin/sh
  #
  # rc.inet1      This shell script boots up the base INET system.

  HOSTNAME=`cat /etc/HOSTNAME` #This is probably not necessary but I
                               #will leave it in anyways

  # Attach the loopback device.
  /sbin/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
  /sbin/route add -net 127.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 lo

  # IF YOU HAVE AN ETHERNET CONNECTION, use these lines below to configure the
  # eth0 interface. If you're only using loopback or SLIP, don't include the
  # rest of the lines in this file.

  /usr/sbin/dhcpcd
  ______________________________________________________________________

  Save it and reboot your computer.



  When you are finished go the ``last step''


  3.3.  RedHat 5.x


  DHCPcd configuration under RedHat 5.0+ is really easy. All you need to
  do is start the Control Panel by typing



  control-panel




    Select "Network Configuration"

    Click on Interfaces

    Click Add

    Select Ethernet

    In the Edit Ethernet/Bus Interface select "Activate interface at
     boot time" as well as select DHCP as Interface configuration
     protocol



  When you are finished go the ``last step''



  3.4.  RedHat 4.x and Caldera OpenLinux 1.1/1.2


  DHCPcd is included in the standard RedHat distribution as an RPM and
  you can find it on your distribution's CD-ROM in RPMS directory or you
  can download it from:





  and install it with

  rpm -i dhcpcd-0.6-2.i386.rpm



  Alternatively you can compile your own version by following the steps
  outlined in the Slackware.



  This information was provided to me by nothing nothing@cc.gatech.edu





  ______________________________________________________________________
  Removed my static ip and name from /etc/resolv.conf. However, I
  did leave in the search line and my two nameserver lines (for some reason my
  dhcpcd never creates a /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf, so I have to use a static
  /etc/resolv.conf).

  In /etc/sysconfig/network I removed the HOSTNAME and GATEWAY
  entries. I left the other entries as is
  (NETWORKING, DOMAINNAME, GATEWAYDEV).

  In /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 I removed the IPADDR,
  NETMASK, NETWORK, and BROADCAST entries. I left DEVICE and ONBOOT as is.
  I changed the BOOTPROTO line to BOOTPROTO=dhcp.

  Save the file. Reboot your computer.
  ______________________________________________________________________



  When you are finished go the ``last step''



  3.5.  Debian


  There is a deb package of DHCPcd at





  or you can follow the Slackware installation instructions.  To unpack
  the deb package type

  dpkg -i /where/ever/your/debian/packages/are/dhcpd*deb



  It appears that there isn't a need for any DHCPcd configuration
  because:

  From: Heiko Schlittermann (heiko@os.inf.tu-dresden.de)



  The dhcpcd package installs it's startup script as usual for debian
  packages in /etc/init.d/<package_name>, here as /etc/init.d/dhcpcd,
  and links this to the various /etc/rc?.d/ directories.



  The contents of the /etc/rc?.d/ dirs is then executed at boot time.



  If you don't reboot after installing you should consider starting the
  daemon manually:


  /etc/init.d/dhcpcd start


  When you are finished go the ``last step''


  3.6.  LinuxPPC and MkLinux


  Following section has been written by R. Shapiro



  Versions 0.65 and 0.70 of Yoichi Hariguchi's dhcpcd should work
  properly in MkLinux and in linuxppc kernel 2.1.24, with the following
  caveats:



  * If you want, or need, to build the executable from sources, note
  that the ppc linux compilers assume that 'char' is 'unsigned char'
  while the Hariguchi sources assume 'char' is 'signed char'. To build
  from sources you must edit the Makefile so that CFLAGS includes the
  option "-fsigned-char".



  * The current stable release of linuxppc [aka linux-pmac] is 2.1.24
  and requires the

  2.1 patch (http://www.cro.net/ vuksan/dhcppatch).  Both the DR2.1 and
  DR3.0 releases of MkLinux use a 2.0 kernel (2.0.33) and do not require
  this patch, although it's harmless to apply it. Note that the dhcpcd
  rpm on the linuxppc cd-rom does not include the 2.1 patch and
  therefore will not work with the linux on that cd! It will work with
  MkLinux however.


  * In linuxppc 2.1.24, you'll see a router warning shortly after dhcpcd
  starts up.  You can ignore this.



  * The Hariguchi dhcpcd takes awhile, about 30 seconds, to make its
  initial connection to the server and to set up routing.  In linuxppc
  2.1.24, the warning mentioned above is an indication that the routing
  is ready.



  For later linuxppc kernels, no version of the Hariguchi dhcpcd will
  work: you  must  use Sergei Viznyuk's version instead (current release
  is 1.3.9: see above for url).  Unfortunately the Viznyuk dhcpcd is
  written for glibc 2, which linuxppc 2.1.1xx isn't.  As a result,
  compiling it is a bit tricky - contact me for details.  Once compiled,
  however, it works fine on late kernels (and not at all in MkLinux or
  linuxppc 2.1.24).



  As far as Viznyuk's version of dhcpcd is concerned I have a Viznyuk
  dhcpcd (v1.3.7) executable that works in recent linuxppc kernels:
  2.1.102, 103, 115, and 119 have been tested.  It's possible to build
  this from sources, but I don't know the details.  The Viznyuk dhcpcd
  doesn't work in 2.1.24, but in that kernel the patched Hariguchi
  dhcpcd works.  The Hariguchi dhcpcd can be built easily from sources.



  Short summary:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  MkLinux:  Hariguchi: yes; Viznyuk, no
  2.1.24:   Hariguchi: yes if patched (easy to build); Viznyuk: no
  2.1.102+: Hariguchi: no; Viznyuk: yes (tricky to build)
  ______________________________________________________________________





  Note that the Viznyuk dhcpcd writes into /etc/resolv.conf directly
  (after renaming the existing one), so there's no need to copy or link
  it from /etc/dhcpc.  Also note that it's typically installed into
  /sbin, not /usr/sbin, and that the command lines options are slightly
  different from the Hariguchi version. These differences may require
  small changes to ifup, if you're starting dhcpcd that way.




  If you want a precompiled dhcpcd for linuxppc, send mail to



  reshapiro@mediaone.net.

  I've also made binary RPMs available in




  Don't use dhcpcd-1.3.8-2.ppc.rpm in that directory, it's broken.  The
  reliable versions here are dhcpcd-0.70-0.ppc.rpm (for linuxppc
  2.1.24), and dhcpcd-1.3.8-3.ppc.rpm (linuxppc 2.1.102 and up). An rpm
  for 1.3.9 should show up shortly.  I also have a modified 1.3.9 which
  includes the -c command-file option, as in 0.65 and 0.70 (the standard
  Viznyuk dhcpcd doesn't include this.)


  3.7.  Token Ring networks


  If you are trying to run dhcpcd on the Token Ring Network it will not
  work.  This is the solution provided to me by Henrik Stoerner
  (henrik_stoerner@olicom.dk)



  The problem is that dhcpcd only knows about Ethernet cards. If it
  finds a Token-Ring card, it refuses to do anything with it and reports
  "interface is not ethernet".



  The solution is to apply a simple patch to the dhcpcd sources. I have
  put up a small web page with the patch, RedHat RPM-files and a
  precompiled binary at



  The patch has been sent to the dhcpcd maintainer, so hopefully it will
  be included in a future release of dhcpcd.




  3.8.  Tying it all together


  After your machine reboots your network interface should be
  configured.  Type:

  ifconfig

  You should get something like this


  ______________________________________________________________________
  lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
            inet addr:127.0.0.1  Bcast:127.255.255.255  Mask:255.0.0.0
            UP BROADCAST LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:3584  Metric:1
            RX packets:302 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
            TX packets:302 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 coll:0

  eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:20:AF:EE:05:45
            inet addr:24.128.53.102  Bcast:24.128.53.255  Mask:255.255.254.0
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            UP BROADCAST NOTRAILERS RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
            RX packets:24783 errors:1 dropped:1 overruns:0 frame:1
            TX packets:11598 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 coll:96
            Interrupt:10 Base address:0x300
  ______________________________________________________________________





  If you have some normal number under inet. addr you are set. If you
  see 0.0.0.0 don't despair, it is a temporary setting before dhcpcd
  acquires the IP address. If even after few minutes you are seeing
  0.0.0.0 please check out  ``troubleshooting''.  DHCPcd is a daemon and
  will stay running as long as you have your machine on. Every three
  hours it will contact the DHCP server and try to renew the IP address
  lease. It will log all the messages in the syslog (on Slackware
  /var/adm/syslog, RedHat/OpenLinux /var/log/syslog).

  One final thing. You need to specify your nameservers. There are two
  ways to do it, you can either ask your provider to provide you with
  the addresses of your name server and then put those in the
  /etc/resolv.conf or DHCPcd will obtain the list from the DHCP server
  and will build a resolv.conf in /etc/dhcpc.  I decided to use DHCPcds
  resolv.conf by doing the following:


  Back up your old /etc/resolv.conf

  mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.OLD

  If directory /etc/dhcpc doesn't exist create it

  mkdir /etc/dhcpc

  Make a link from /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf to /etc/resolv.conf

  ln -s /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf


  If that doesn't work try this (fix suggested by nothing@cc.gatech.edu
  with a little amendment by Henrik Stoerner)



  This last step I had to perform only because my dhcpcd doesn't create
  an /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf.  In /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup I
  made the following changes (which are a very poor hack, but they work
  for me):





  ______________________________________________________________________
  elif [ "$BOOTPROTO" = dhcp -a "$ISALIAS" = no ]; then
      echo -n "Using DHCP for ${DEVICE}... "
      /sbin/dhcpcd -c /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdhcpc-done ${DEVICE}
      echo "echo \$$ > /var/run/dhcp-wait-${DEVICE}.pid; exec sleep 30" | sh

      if [ -f /var/run/dhcp-wait-${DEVICE}.pid ]; then
          ^^^^
          echo "failed."
          exit 1
  ______________________________________________________________________



  I changed to:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  elif [ "$BOOTPROTO" = dhcp -a "$ISALIAS" = no ]; then
      echo -n "Using DHCP for ${DEVICE}... "
      /sbin/dhcpcd
      echo "echo \$$ > /var/run/dhcp-wait-${DEVICE}.pid; exec sleep 30" | sh

      if [ ! -f /var/run/dhcp-wait-${DEVICE}.pid ]; then
          ^^^^^^
         echo "failed."
         exit 1
  ______________________________________________________________________





  Notice the ! (bang) in if [ ! -f /var/run/dhcp-wait-${DEVICE}.pid ];





  Now sit back and enjoy :-).

  3.9.  Various notes


  Following step(s) are not necessary but might be useful to some people

  a)  If you need network connectivity only occasionally you can start
  dhcpcd from the command line (you have to be root to do this) with:


  /usr/sbin/dhcpcd

  When you need to down (turn off) the network type

  /usr/sbin/dhcpcd -k


  3.10.  Troubleshooting


  If you have followed the steps outlined above and you are unable to
  access the network there are several possible explanations:



  I. Your network card is not configured properly.


  During the boot up process your Linux will probe your network card and
  should say something along these lines:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  eth0: 3c509 at 0x300 tag 1, 10baseT port, address  00 20 af ee 11 11, IRQ 10.
  3c509.c:1.07 6/15/95 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
  ______________________________________________________________________



  If a message like this doesn't appear your ethernet card might not be
  recognized by your Linux system. If you have a generic ethernet card
  (a NE2000 clone) you should have received a disk with DOS utilities
  that you can use to set up the card. Try playing with IRQs until Linux
  recognizes your card (IRQ 9,10,12 are usually good).



  II. Your DHCP server supports RFC 1541/My DHCP server is Windows NT


  Try running dhcpcd by typing

  dhcpcd -r

  Use ifconfig to check if your network interface is configured (wait
  few seconds for the configuration process, initally it will say
  Inet.addr=0.0.0.0)

  If this solves your problem add the "-r" flag to the boot up scripts
  ie. instead of /sbin/dhcpcd you will have /sbin/dhcpcd -r



  For example under RedHat edit script /etc/sysconfig/network-
  scripts/ifup and change the following


  ______________________________________________________________________
          IFNAME=$[ {DEVICE} \
          "/sbin/dhcpcd -r -c /etc/"- etc etc.
  ______________________________________________________________________





  III. During bootup I get error message "Using DHCP for eth0 ...
  failed" but my system works fine.



  You are most likely using RedHat and you haven't followed instructions
  carefully :-). You are missing the ! (bang) in one of the if
  statements.  Jump ``here'' and check how to fix it.



  IV. My network works for few minutes and then stops responding



  There are some reports of gated (gateway daemon) screwing up routing
  on Linux boxes which results in problem described above. Check if
  gated is running



  ps -auxww | grep gate



  If it is try removing it with RedHat's RPM manager or removing the
  entry in /etc/rc.d/



  V. My ethernet card is recognized during boot up but I still get "NO
  DHCPOFFER" message in my logs. I also happen to have a PCMCIA ethernet
  card.



  You need to make sure that you have the 10BaseT port ("phone" plug) on
  your network card activated. Best way to verify it is to check what
  kind of connector your card is configured for during bootup e.g.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  eth0: 3c509 at 0x300 tag 1, 10baseT port, address  00 20 af ee 11 11, IRQ 10.
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^
  3c509.c:1.07 6/15/95 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
  ______________________________________________________________________





  I have received reports of laptop users having this kind of problems
  due to the PCMCIA utilities (specifically ifport) that would set the
  connector type to 10Base2 (thinnet). You have to make sure you use
  10BaseT for your connection. If you are not reconfigure the card and
  restart the computer.



  VI. My DHCP client broadcasts requests but no one answers (Contributed
  by Peter Amstutz)



  On some systems, you need to include some hostname for your machine as
  part of the request.  With dhcpcd, do this with 'dhcpcd -h foohost'
  Probably the hostname wanted will be your account username on the
  network.



  VII. I have followed all the steps but still my machine is not able to
  connect
  The cable modem will usually memorize the ethernet address of your
  network card so if you connect a new computer or switch network cards
  you will somehow have to "teach" your cable modem to recognize the new
  computer/card. Usually you can turn of the modem and bring it back up
  while computer is on or you will have to call tech support and tell
  them that you have changed a network card in the computer.



  You have firewall rules (ipfwadm rules) that disallow port 67/68
  traffic used by DHCP to distribute configuration info. Check your
  firewall rules carefully.



  VIII. I have MediaOne Express service and I still can't connect.



  It appears that MediaOne has been using adding some things to DHCP
  that shouldn't be there. Supposedly this is not a problem anymore but
  if you experience outages check for these things. If you are (un)lucky
  to have Windows NT on your machine if you go into Event Viewer you
  will see a warning like this.


  DHCP received an unknown option 067 of length 005. The raw option data
  is given  below.

  0000: 62 61 73 69 63            basic


  If this is the problem go to

  and either download a binary or get the source for the change.









  4.  DHCP Server Setup

  4.1.  DHCP server for UNIX

  There are several DHCP servers available for U*X-like OSes, both
  commercial and free. One of the more popular free DHCP servers is Paul
  Vixie/ISC DHCPd. Currently the latest version is 1.0 (suggested for
  most users) but 2.0 is in beta testing.  You can get them from




  After you download it you need to unpack it. After you do cd into the
  distribution directory and type:

  ./configure

  It will take some time to configure the settings. After it is done
  type:

  make

  and

  make install




  4.2.  Network Configuration.


  When done with installation type ifconfig -a. You should see something
  like this:




  ______________________________________________________________________
  eth0      Link encap:10Mbps Ethernet  HWaddr 00:C0:4F:D3:C4:62
            inet addr:183.217.19.43  Bcast:183.217.19.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
            UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
            RX packets:2875542 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0
            TX packets:218647 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0
            Interrupt:11 Base address:0x210
  ______________________________________________________________________





  If it doesn't say MULTICAST you should reconfigure your kernel and add
  multicast support. On most systems you will not need to do this.



  Next step is to add route for 255.255.255.255. Quoted from DHCPd
  README:



  "In order for dhcpd to work correctly with picky DHCP clients (e.g.,
  Windows 95), it must be able to send packets with an IP destination
  address of 255.255.255.255.  Unfortunately, Linux insists on changing
  255.255.255.255 into the local subnet broadcast address (here, that's
  192.5.5.223).  This results in a DHCP protocol violation, and while
  many DHCP clients don't notice the problem, some (e.g., all Microsoft
  DHCP clients) do.  Clients that have this problem will appear not to
  see DHCPOFFER messages from the server."



  Type:

  route add -host 255.255.255.255 dev eth0

  If you get a message

  "255.255.255.255: Unknown host"

  You should try adding the following entry to your /etc/hosts file:

  255.255.255.255 all-ones

  Then, try:

  route add -host all-ones dev eth0

  or

  route add -net 255.255.255.0 dev eth0

  eth0 is of course the name of the network device you are using.  If it
  differs change appropriately.




  4.3.  Options for DHCPd


  Now you need to configure DHCPd. In order to do this you will have to
  create or edit /etc/dhcpd.conf.



  Most commonly what you want to do is assign IP addresses randomly.
  This can be done with settings as follows




  ______________________________________________________________________

  option routers 192.168.1.254;

     range 192.168.1.150 192.168.1.200;
  }

  This will result in DHCP server giving a client an IP address from the
  range 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.100 or 192.168.1.150-192.168.1.200. It
  will lease an IP address for 600 seconds if the client doesn't ask for
  specific time frame. Otherwise the maximum (allowed) lease will be
  7200 seconds. The server will also "advise" the client that it should
  use 255.255.255.0 as its subnet mask,  192.168.1.255 as its broadcast
  address, 192.168.1.254 as the router/gateway and 192.168.1.1 and
  192.168.1.2 as its DNS servers.



  You can also assign specific IP addresses based on clients ethernet
  address e.g.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  host haagen {
     hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
     fixed-address 192.168.1.222;
  }
  ______________________________________________________________________


  This will assign IP address 192.168.1.222 to a client with ethernet
  address 08:00:2b:4c:59:23.



  You can also mix and match e.g. you can have certain clients getting
  "static" IP addresses (e.g. servers) and others being alloted dynamic
  IPs (e.g. mobile users with laptops). There are a number of other
  options e.g. wins server addresses, time server etc., if you need any
  of those options please read the dhcpd.conf man page.




  4.4.  Starting the server


  You can now invoke the DHCP server. Simply type (or include in the
  bootup scripts)

  /usr/sbin/dhcpd

  If you want to verify that everything is working fine you should first
  turn on the debugging mode and put the server in foreground. You can
  do this by typing

  /usr/sbin/dhcpd -d -f

  Then boot up one of your clients and check out the console of your
  server.  You will see a number of debugging messages coming up.
