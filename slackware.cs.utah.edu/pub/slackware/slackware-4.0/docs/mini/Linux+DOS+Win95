How To Boot Linux, DOS, and Windows 95 from one Hard Drive using Lilo.

The problem:

W95 and DOS get confused if more than one partition is marked active,
so it's necessary for the boot manager to activate their partition 
before booting them, and to unmark any others.  W95 and DOS also for
some reason relabel partitions on the booted device so that the OS
always appears to be located on drive C.  So for example, even if
you install DOS into partition E on your main drive, it will appear
as partition C when it's booted.

1.  Use Linux fdisk or Partition Magic to create three partitions on
    your drive.    Install W95 on one partition, DOS on one with
    (for example) format /s c:, and Linux on the third.  If you have
    only one (DOS) partition on your drive to start with, Partition
    Magic is the easy way to break it up into three.   FIPS does the
    same thing for free, but it's a little trickier to run.
    
2.  Get a copy of lilo.17.tar.gz, which as of August 1996 was the only
    revision with the ability to update the active flag at boot time.
    There's a copy at ftp://ftp.ezlink.com/pub/lilo.17.tar.gz.
    Compile and install it with REWRITE_TABLE defined in the Makefile.

Install something like the following in /etc/lilo.conf and run /sbin/lilo
to update the MBR record on your drive:


    boot = /dev/sda
    compact
    delay = 5		# optional, for systems that boot very quickly
    vga = normal	# force sane state
    ramdisk = 0		# paranoia setting
    root = current	# use "current" root

    image = /vmlinuz.1.3.97
      append = "aha1542=0x230 ro"
      label = linux

    other = /dev/sda1
      table = /dev/sda
      rewrite-table
      label = dos

    other = /dev/sda2
      table = /dev/sda
      rewrite-table
      label = w95
