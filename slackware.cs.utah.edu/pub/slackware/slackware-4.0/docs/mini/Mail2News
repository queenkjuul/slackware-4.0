  2.  Introduction

  Most Internet sites are always seeking ways to improve the usage of
  the limited bandwidth awailable across their link to the Internet.

  Should more than one user subscribe to the same mailing list, there is
  going to be traffic duplication. If there are a number of such
  duplications - or the traffic on the lists is high, the consumption of
  bandwidth increases.

  By subscribing the site to a list (if this is allowed by the list
  owner) and 'gating' the email traffic to the local news server, it is
  possible to make mailing lists accessible to all site users, or, using
  the security features of 'innd', to limit the access to certain users.

  Such a site subscription (particularly if there are a number of high
  traffic lists) can make worthwhile savings in bandwidth usage.

  Reading list traffic in news reader also offers users the advantages
  of threading (which is not available in many mail user agents) and
  keeps their mail 'inbox' free for possibly more urgent, personal
  email.

  This mini-HOWTO describes setting up the 'mail2news.pl' script to
  accomplish this.

  2.1.  Finding mail2news.pl

  The author has been unable to find mail2news.pl on CPAN (the
  Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) - but it may just have been
  overlooked. It is however on sunsite.unc.edu - somewhere - and also on
  ftp.redhat.com.

  As this Perl script is not lengthy, it is appended to this howto.

  3.  Overview of the system

  It is probably easiest to understand how this system works by tracking
  a message from the mailing list to the newsgroup and then a message
  posted to the local newsgroup (gated to the mailing list) and see how
  they are handled.

  3.1.  Mail from the mailing list

  Mail from the mailing list is sent to all subscribed mail addresses. A
  special mail alias is subscribed to the mailing list in question and
  so all traffic to and from the list is sent by the list server to this
  address.

  When mail from the mailing list arrives at the local machine, the mail
  alias pipes the incoming message to mail2news.pl. The mail alias also
  specifies the destination (local) newsgroup.

  The mail2news.pl script processes the message, applying news headers
  and then uses rnews or inews to post the message to the newsgroup.

  3.2.  Messages posted to the local newsgroup

  The local newsgroup is set up as a moderated group, as this allows us
  to take advantage of the email capabilities of innd. Any messages
  posted to a moderated group are not immediately submitted to the
  group. Instead, messages are emailed to the moderator of the group.

  By declaring the moderator of the local newsgroup to be mailing list
  address, all locally posted messages to the newsgroup are
  automatically mailed out to the mailing list by innd and only appear
  once they have been received back through mail2news.pl which adds the
  necessary 'approved' line to the messages and are thus acceptable to
  innd for posting to the newsgroup.

  4.  Setting up mail2news

  Put the mail2news.pl script in a suitable location. I favour
  /usr/local/scripts, but the location is up to you.

  You will need to edit script as follows:-

    At the top of the script, make sure you are pointing at the local
     Perl binary

     ___________________________________________________________________
     #!/usr/bin/perl
     # point at the correct location of perl
     ___________________________________________________________________

    I had problems with the three following lines. Commenting them out
     does not cause a problem.

     ___________________________________________________________________
     ( $version  ) = $] =~ /(\d+\.\d+).*\nPatch level/;
     die "$program: requires at least version 3 of perl\n"
             if $version < 3;
     ___________________________________________________________________

    Edit the following lines to point at the posting program (I use
     rnews) and you news host:-

     ___________________________________________________________________
     # $inews = "/usr/bin/inews";
     # $iopts = "-h -o \"mail2news gateway\"";
     $inews = "/usr/bin/rnews";
     $iopts = "";
     $postinghost = "your.news.server";   # points at your news server
     ___________________________________________________________________

    Make sure that the script is exectuable (mode 755).

  5.  Establishing the mail aliases

  Edit /etc/aliases to create entries for the mailing list(s) you wish
  to pipe into news. Each entry should be of the form:-

  ______________________________________________________________________
  <subscribed email address to list>: \
          "| /usr/local/scripts/mail2news.pl <local news group name>"
  <code>

  <p>
  So for example if the email address to which email from the list is to
  be sent (the subscribed mail address) is <tt/site_list/ and the local
  newsgroup to which mail is to be posted is <tt/local.site.group/, the
  alias would be

  <code>
  # The site subscription address for blah-blah@some.mailing.list
  site_list: "| /usr/local/scripts/mail2news.pl local.site.group"
  ______________________________________________________________________

  Make an entry for each mailing list that is to be gated to oyur local
  news server and and then run newaliases.

  6.  Setting up the news groups and news server (innd)

  Using ctlinnd, create the newsgroups on your news server. Remember,
  these are to be local news groups, so start them with a distinctive
  name so you can filter them out from your news distributions (in your
  newsfeeds file).

  You also need to tell innd that the group is moderated (by using
  ctlinnd). Remember, innd is very sensitive to file ownership and
  permissions, so you need to interct at this level with innd as the
  news user. Indicating a moderated group is done by specifying m to the
  newgroup command.

  ______________________________________________________________________
          ctlinnd newgroup <newgroup name> m <newsadmin>
  ______________________________________________________________________

  The m tells innd that the group is moderated.

  Edit your newsfeeds file to make sure that these local groups are not
  distributed (unless you specificaly wish this to occur).

  For example, if your mailing list is called local.site.group, then you
  would probably want to add !local* to the second field of your up (and
  possibly your down) stream news sites in your newsfeeds file.

  Now, in order to ensure that user messages are sent to the list
  automatically by innd, edit /etc/news/moderators to include a line
  declaring the mailing list email address as the moderator.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  some.site.list:list@mail.list.site
  ______________________________________________________________________

  7.  Subscribing the mail2 news alias to the mailing list

  You now need to subscribe the mail alias to the mailing list. Check
  with the mailing list information as to how to subscribe. Some mailing
  lists allow you to subscribe an email address that is different from
  the address from which the subscription comes (they check back to the
  address to be subscribed for confirmation before actually subscribing
  that address).

  Other mailing lists do not permit this. So you may need to 'forge' a
  subscription request. There are many ways of doing this. One of the
  easiest is to use Netscape mail set up (temporarily) with the address
  to which the mailing list is to send the mail.

  After subscribing, you should see a 'welcome' message of some kind
  from the list server in the news group - in which case all is well and
  you can now test the other direction by posting a news message to your
  new list.

  The message should *NOT* appear in the newsgroup at once. It should
  get sent out by mail and then received back and posted to the news
  group.

  If this works, you have succeed in getting the list gated to news.

  8.  If it doesn't work...

  If things don't work, you need to track through the path the messages
  are taking to see exactly where things are breaking down. Useful tools
  here are the mail and news logs.
