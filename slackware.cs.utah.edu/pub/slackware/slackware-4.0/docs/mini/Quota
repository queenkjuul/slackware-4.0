  This document describes how to enable file system quota on a Linux
  host, assigning quota for users and groups, as well as the usage of
  miscellaneous quota commands. It is intended for users running kernel
  2.x (recently tested on RedHat 4.1 running kernel 2.0.27). Users run­
  ning older kernels may need to upgrade to a newer kernel version in
  order to take advantage of quota.  Feel free to send feedbacks or com­
  ments to bertie@scn.org if you find an error, or if any information is
  missing. I appreciate it.

  1.  What is Quota?


  Quota allows you to specify limits on two aspects of disk storage: the
  number of inodes a user or a group of users may possess; and the
  number of disk blocks that may be allocated to a user or a group of
  users.

  The idea behind quota is that users are forced to stay under their
  disk comsumption limit, taking away their ability to comsume unlimited
  disk space on a system. Quota is handled on a per user, per file
  system basis. If there is more than one file system which a user is
  expected to create files, then quota must be set for each file system
  seperately.

  2.  Current Status of Quota on Linux


  Quota support has been integrated into kernel since version 1.3.8x I
  heard.  Now it is part of the 2.0 release of the Linux kernel. If your
  system doesn't support quota, I really recommend an upgrade.

  Currently, quota works for ext2 type file system only.

  3.  Requirements for Using Quota on Linux


  3.1.  Kernel


  The 2.x kernel source is available from

  ______________________________________________________________________
  http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/v2.0
  ______________________________________________________________________



  3.2.  Quota software


  Depending on the Linux distribution you have, you may, or may not have
  the quota softwares installed on your system. If you don't, then
  download the quota software source from

  ______________________________________________________________________
  ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/subsystems/quota/all.tar.gz.
  ______________________________________________________________________



  4.  Quota Setup on Linux - Part I: The Configuration


  4.1.  Reconfigure your kernel


  Reconfigure your kernel and add quota support by typing y to:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  Quota support (CONFIG_QUOTA) [n] y
  ______________________________________________________________________



  4.2.  Compile and install the quota softwares


  The quota software source is available from

  ______________________________________________________________________
  ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/subsystems/quota/all.tar.gz
  ______________________________________________________________________



  4.3.  time Modify your system init script to check quota and turn
  quota on at boot


  Here's an example:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  # Check quota and then turn quota on.
  if [ -x /usr/sbin/quotacheck ]
          then
                 echo "Checking quotas. This may take some time."
                 /usr/sbin/quotacheck -avug
                 echo " Done."
          fi
           if [ -x /usr/sbin/quotaon ]
          then
                  echo "Turning on quota."
                  /usr/sbin/quotaon -avug
          fi
  ______________________________________________________________________



  The golden rule is that always turn quota on after your file systems
  in /etc/fstab have been mounted, otherwise quota will fail to work. I
  recommend turning quota on at the end of your system init script, or,
  if you like, right after the part where file systems are mounted in
  your system init script.

  4.4.  Modify /etc/fstab



  Partitions that you have not yet enabled quota normally look something
  like:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  /dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
  /dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults        1       1
  ______________________________________________________________________



  To enable user quota support on a file system, add "usrquota" to the
  fourth field containing the word "defaults" (man fstab for details).

  ______________________________________________________________________
  /dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
  /dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults,usrquota       1       1
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Replace "usrquota" with "grpquota", should you need group quota
  support on a file system.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  /dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
  /dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults,grpquota       1       1
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Need both user quota and group quota support on a file system?

  ______________________________________________________________________
  /dev/hda1       /       ext2    defaults        1       1
  /dev/hda2       /usr    ext2    defaults,usrquota,grpquota       1   1
  ______________________________________________________________________



  4.5.  Create quota record "quota.user" and "quota.group"


  Both quota record files, quota.user and quota.group, should be owned
  by root, and read-write permission for root and none for anybody else.

  Login as root. Go to the root of the partition you wish to enable
  quota, then create quota.user and quota.group by doing:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  touch /partition/quota.user
  touch /partition/quota.group
  chmod 600 /partition/quota.user
  chmod 600 /partition/quota.group
  ______________________________________________________________________



  4.6.  Reboot


  Now reboot system for the changes you have made to take effect.

  Also note that subsequent partitions you wish to enable quota in the
  future only require step 4, 5, and 6.


  5.  Quota Setup on Linux - Part II: Assigning Quota for Users and
  Groups


  This operation is performed with the edquota command (man edquota for
  details).

  I would normally run quotacheck with the flags -avug to obtain the
  most updated filesystems usage prior to editing quota. This is just a
  personal habit, and not a required step however.

  5.1.  Assigning quota for a particular user


  Here's an example. I have a user with the login id bob on my system.
  The command "edquota -u bob" takes me into vi (or editor specified in
  my $EDITOR environment variable) to edit quota for user bob on each
  partition that has quota enabled:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  Quotas for user bob:
  /dev/hda2: blocks in use: 2594, limits (soft = 5000, hard = 6500)
           inodes in use: 356, limits (soft = 1000, hard = 1500)
  ______________________________________________________________________



  "blocks in use" is the total number of blocks (in kilobytes) a user
  has comsumed on a partition.

  "inodes in use" is the total number of files a user has on a
  partition.

  5.2.  Assigning quota for a particular group


  Now I have a group games on my system. "edquota -g games" takes me
  into the vi editor again to edit quota for the group games:

  ______________________________________________________________________
          Quotas for group games:
          /dev/hda4: blocks in use: 5799, limits (soft = 8000, hard = 10000)
                  inodes in use: 1454, limits (soft = 3000, hard = 4000)
  ______________________________________________________________________



  5.3.  Assigning quota for a bunch of users with the same value


  To rapidly set quotas for, say 100 users, on my system to the same
  value as my user bob, I would first edit bob's quota information by
  hand, then execute:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  edquota -p bob `awk -F: '$3 > 499 {print $1}' /etc/passwd`
  ______________________________________________________________________



  assuming that you are using csh, and that you assign your user UID's
  starting with 500.

  In addition to edquota, there are 3 terms which you should familiarize
  yourself with: Soft Limit, Hard Limit, and Grace Period.

  5.4.  Soft Limit


  _Soft limit_ indicates the maximum amount of disk usage a quota user
  has on a partition. When combined with grace period, it acts as the
  border line, which a quota user is issued warnings about his impending
  quota violation when passed.

  5.5.  Hard Limit


  Hard limit works only when grace period is set. It specifies the
  absolute limit on the disk usage, which a quota user can't go beyond
  his hard limit.

  5.6.  Grace Period


  Executed with the command "edquota -t", grace period is a time limit
  before the soft limit is enforced for a file system with quota
  enabled. Time units of sec(onds), min(utes), hour(s), day(s), week(s),
  and month(s) can be used.  This is what you'll see with the command
  "edquota -t":

  ______________________________________________________________________
  Time units may be: days, hours, minutes, or seconds
  Grace period before enforcing soft limits for users:
  /dev/hda2: block grace period: 0 days, file grace period: 0 days
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Change the 0 days part to any length of time you feel reasonable. I
  personally would choose 7 days (or 1 week).

  6.  Miscellaneous Quota Commands


  6.1.  Quotacheck


  Quotacheck is used to scan a file system for disk usages, and updates
  the quota record file "quota.user" to the most recent state. I
  recommend running quotacheck at system bootup, or via cronjob
  periodically (say, every week?).

  6.2.  Repquota


  Repquota produces a summarized quota information for a file system.
  Here is a sample output repquota gives:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  # repquota -a
                                  Block limits               File limits
          User            used    soft    hard  grace    used  soft  hard  grace
          root      --  175419       0       0          14679     0     0
          bin       --   18000       0       0            735     0     0
          uucp      --     729       0       0             23     0     0
          man       --      57       0       0             10     0     0
          user1     --   13046   15360   19200            806  1500  2250
          user2     --    2838    5120    6400            377  1000  1500
  ______________________________________________________________________



  6.3.  Quotaon and Quotaoff


  Quotaon is used to turn on quota accouting; quotaoff to turn it off.
  Actually both files are similar. They are executed at system startup
  and shutdown.
