Global Linux-TIA HOWTO

version 2.0T (updated 12/16/95) by Irish

This document will describe how to get your Linux box to connect to a
generic site via TIA, The Internet Adaptor. I take no responsibility for
your use of this information, but corrections are welcome. 

I will not attempt to describe all that can be done over this connection
once established, but I will refer you to other documents or sites that
will contain the relevant information. 

That done, let's do it!



   1.0 What is TIA? 

   The Intenet Adaptor was written by the fine folks at marketplace.com. It is
   used to simulate a SLIP connection from a shell account. It costs $25 for a
   single user license, site licenses are available. It works with any client
   OS that uses standard TCP/IP and SLIP networking, and clients.

   1.1 How does TIA work?

   It is important to understand how TIA works in general, to be aware of its
   limitations. First, you do not need to install TIA on your machine. It 
   runs on your remote host only. What you need is the TCP/IP and SLIP 
   protocols installed in your kernel (more on that in a bit), and some clients.

   Here's what happens: you send network requests from your machine to your
   remote host over the SLIP link. TIA grabs them and sends them out to the Net
   at large. Then, incoming data is sent back from the Net to your account on 
   the remote host, where TIA grabs it and sends it back over the SLIP link 
   to your machine. So, to the Net it appears as if you are working out of 
   your account on the remote host, but to you it looks like you are really 
   connected right to the Net.

   As you can see, this can confuse stuff that is incoming from the Net. For
   example, talk doesn't work via TIA, because the incoming talk request 
   tries to start the remote hosts talk daemon, not yours.

   The other big difference between TIA and real SLIP is you are NOT assigned
   your own IP address; remember, you are only converting a dialup account to a
   SLIP connection.

   1.2 What about Term?

   What about it? My opinion; Using Term is like using a crank to start 
   your car, a lot of work and completely unnessesary. Of course, if you 
   don't have root access to your machine for one reason or another, and 
   you can't persuade someone who does to install SLIP and dip, then you 
   won't have much choice. If you really want to know more about Term, read 
   the HOWTO on Sunsite. 

   1.3 What about SLiRP?

   This is new, and it's free because it's GPLed. TIA isn't free, but it's 
   real cheap, real stable, and well supported and documented. Go ahead and 
   try it if you wish. I have heard that the following information works for 
   SLiRP with only minor modifications, but please don't mail me with 
   questions because I really don't know anything about it. Don't get me 
   wrong, obviously I have nothing against free software, but TIA is what 
   I know and use. Besides, for me TIA is free, because the Admin here 
   purchased a site license. Maybe you can convince yours, it's worth it, 
   for you and them. 


Enough already! How do I set it up?

   2.0 Preparing your Linux machine

   In a nutshell, here's what's required. I'll explain each of these in detail.

      -> Compile your kernel to include SLIP and TCP/IP 
      -> Edit some files in /etc 
      -> Install and configure dip 
   You will also need to get the TIA binary appropriate for your remote host 
   and install it. All of the relevant info for this is available at TIAs home 
   site. 

   NOTENOTENOTE: TIA 2.0.5 is out now. It supports, among other things,
   CSLIP and PPP. There are very few changes required to use CSLIP, and they
   are noted below. A PPP HOWTO will be forthcoming soon, as well as
   documentation on some new features. Watch this space!

That's it! Let's get started.

   2.1 Compiling your kernel

   If you have never done this, you should. And you should read the FAQ 
   first, but don't worry, it's easy. If you want, you can e-mail me and 
   I'll help.

   I'll assume that you have here, for the sake of brevity. When you 'make 
   config', look for "Network Devices". Say 'y', of course, then say 'y' to 
   SLIP and TCP/IP, (Tia 2.0.5 users: say 'y' to CSLIP instead/also) and 'n' 
   to everything else, unless you have ethercards or need some other protocol 
   for something else. If you don't do this, it won't work! Finish compiling 
   and installing the new kernel, then,

   2.2 Edit some files in /etc

   These files will set up your routes to your remote host. /etc is the 
   directory for system configurations. Replace everything in double quotes 
   with the appropriate values, naturally (but don't include the quotes - 
   they are there for reference). There are three files you need to edit, 
   they are:

      /etc/hosts: 

      127.0.0.1       localhost
      192.0.2.1       "your.hostname.domain"
      "XXX.XXX.XX.XX" "remote.hostname.domain remote"  #<-- Note the abbreviation.
              

      /etc/host.conf: 

      order hosts, bind
      multi on
              

      /etc/resolv.conf: 

      domain "yourdomainhere"         
      nameserver "XXX.XXX.XX.XX"      #<- Usually the same as in /etc/hosts
              

      To use an NNTPserver, put this line in your /etc/profile:

      export NNTPSERVER="remote.hosts.nntpservername"

   2.3.1 Dip

   Dip is what you will use to dial up the remote host, start TIA, and 
   convert the line to SLIP. It comes in the "N" set of Slackware, along 
   with a bunch of clients and utilities, some of which you may want to 
   install also =). It is also available at Sunsite in an individual tar file.

   Once you have it installed, you will need to have a dip script, Here's 
   a sample, just plug in the appropriate stuff where the double quotes 
   are (but don't include the quotes, they are there for reference).

   ----------CUT HERE--------------------------------

   main:
     get $local "your.hostname.domain"
     get $remote "remote.hostname.domain"
     port cua"?"                   #<-- Your port here
     speed 38400                   #<--You may be able to use 57400 in newer 
     reset                         # kernels
     init AT "string of commands"  #<--don't use spaces in your AT command string 
     wait OK 5

   # This will redial. If it doesn't work, play with the wait time (listen 
   # to your modem). If it still doesn't work, mail me.
   # See also; the note at the bottom of the script re: error codes.

   dial:
     dial "phonenumber"
     print Dialing...
     if $errlvl != 0 goto error
     wait BUSY 20                  #<--You may need to change this wait time  
     if $errlvl == 0 goto dial     #   to suit your modem

   login:
     print Connected and Logging in...
     wait ==> 60                   #<-- This wait and send get me past my 
     send 4\n                      #<-- hosts Annex. Change for your site!
     wait ogin: 60
     if $errlvl != 0 goto login_error1
     send "LOGIN"\n
     wait assword: 60
     if $errlvl != 0 goto login_error2
     send "PASSWORD"\n

   loggedin:
     wait "SYSTEM PROMPT" 60
     if $errlvl != 0 goto shell_error
     send tia\n
     wait software. 60
     if $errlvl != 0 goto tia_error
     print Starting TIA...
     get $mtu 296          #<--Tia recommends 1500, but this is faster 
     default               #interactively. Ftp may be slower, so adjust to taste.

   done:
     print CONNECTED to $remote with address $rmtip
     mode SLIP
   # TIA 2.0.5 users: change the above line to 
   # mode CSLIP
     goto exit

   error:
     print Dialing Error

   login_error1:
     print No Login

   login_error2:
     print No Password prompt

   shell_error:
     print No shell prompt

   tia_error:
     There was a problem starting TIA

   exit:
     \r            #<--This will error out with the -v flag, but work when 
                   #run normally (ends dip at a local prompt).

   -------------CUT HERE-----------------------------

   2.3.2 Dip notes

   Newer versions of dip don't return modem status codes (BUSY, NO
   CONNECT, etc.), they use numbers instead. Here's a table:

      0 = OK 
      1 = CONNECT 
      2 = ERROR 
      3 = BUSY 
      4 = NO CARRIER

   This would make your dial section look like this:

   dial:
     dial "phonenumber"
     print Dialing...
     if $errlvl != 0 goto error
     wait 1 20     
     if $errlvl != 1 goto dial

   Thanks to Lee Olds (lee@eskimo.com) for that bit. 

   \n = newline, \r = carriage return. You may require one or the other (or 
   both) in the appropriate places. If the ones provided don't work, experiment.

   After editing this file, rename it, say, remote.dip and put it in /root. 
   Then, as root, run 'dip remote'. Use the -v flag the first time to debug 
   it ('dip -v remote'), this will show you all the steps dip takes.

   Dip will only run as root, but there is a way to make it run from a user 
   account. For now, if you need this info, ask. I may include it in this 
   file later if enough people want it.

   If dip errors out right away, try removing the comments from the script.



   3.0 Now what?

   Hey, if all went well, you are now connected to the Net! Try a 'telnet 
   remote' (remember that abbreviation in your hosts file?). You should get 
   the remotes telnet login prompt. Go on, try it! You can now telnet/FTP/etc.
   anywhere on the Net from your local machine. How? Your machine is using 
   the remote as a nameserver to resolve addresses (resolv.conf). Experiment,
   find out what works and what doesn't.

   You will not be able to use services that are not provided already on your
   remote host! For example, if your server doesn't allow telnets, chances 
   are you can't do it either. Why? Because TIA is only re-directing what 
   is already available.

   3.1 News and Mail

   I have found a News Reader that is fairly simple to install and use. It 
   is a true NNTP newsreader, which means no local news transport is required 
   to make it work (you don't have install Cnews or INN). It does require 
   that you have access to an NNTPserver, naturally, but most ISPs have this.
   If you are able to use MSWIN apps like WinVN with your provider, this will 
   work too. It is text based, but has color and mouse support, and runs 
   fine in an rxvt window.  SLRN is still beta, but I have been using it 
   exclusively for a while now, without any problems. 

   I am still looking for a good Mail Reader of the SMTP/POP3 variety, that 
   will work no matter what state the local mail transport is in (from 
   non-existent to fully functional). It doesn't have to be X based, but 
   that would be a plus. If you have any suggestions, please send tham along 
   to me. I am aware of things like popclient, but this seems a little 
   clumsy to me, and I'd like to find a mail reader that at least handles 
   the retreival chores.

   3.2 Mosaic/Netscape

   Obviously, you will need to have X running for this to work, but it's 
   a simple matter of FTPing the binary, unpacking it, and installing it. 

   3.3 Remote X

   You can run remote X applications via TIA. The TIA-X HOWTO is 
   available at the places listed below.


   4.0 Misc.

   If I've left anything out, or you still have questions, I read my mail 
   daily. This information gets updated fairly regularly, so keep checking 
   back every so often (I'll change the version numbers). Naturally, the 
   more you contribute, the more info will be included here, so don't 
   hesitate to tell me about whatever you have to offer.

   If you would like some help, or are having trouble with your setup, I'll 
   help but you must send me the following info: 
   1. A copy of your three /etc files. 
   2. A copy of your script output, run with the -v flag (please remove 
   your password from this!)

   Even if you don't have anything to contribute, but used this info
   sucsessfully, PLEASE MAIL ME. I want to know how useful this really is.
