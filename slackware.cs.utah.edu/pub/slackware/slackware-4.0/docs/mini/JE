  A. Introduction
  ===============

  A-1: What is JE?
  ----------------

  First, why do we even need JE? What's the big deal?

  Well, the deal is, Japanese uses different characters than the
  roman alphabet.  And unlike some puny languages that are content 
  with less than a hundred characters, Japanese uses thousands of 
  characters (Ha!). They borrowed a lot from China, added some of 
  their own, and recently incorporated the Roman characters, too. 
  Don't ask how they live with this mess, they just do. Since the 
  number of characters is clearly more than can be assigned to a 
  single byte code set, they use 2-byte code sets.

  Obviously, to use any Japanese on Linux, extra fonts for Japanese 
  characters are required.  And then, many existing software have 
  never even dreamt of 2-byte character sets.  These need to be 
  tweaked, or a Japanese-savvy equivalent must be developed.  Also, 
  normal keyboards have only so many keys (like 101 or 106). 
  Japanese need an input method that can input thousands of chars 
  using only a hundred keys.

  Amazingly, JE takes care of all these.

  JE (Japanese Extensions for Linux) is a collection of free 
  softwares to create a Japanese Language environment for standard 
  distributions of the Linux system (ex. Slackware, SLS, Debian, 
  with a heavy inclination toward Slackware). Most of the programs 
  are ported or developed by members of the Japanese Linux Mailing 
  List. They are available both as binaries and source codes, though 
  the basic distribution only contains the binary.
  
  The binaries are tar+gzip'ed. They could be installed using 
  standard installers like "pkgtool" or "sysinstall". However, to 
  make life easier for you, JE has its own installer named "ezinst" 
  which even takes care of some basic configuration.



  A-2: Contents of the JE Package
  -------------------------------
  
  JE consists of software to display, input, edit, format, and print 
  Japanese characters and documents, as well as small but fancy 
  made-in-Japan software, including;
  
  1) Japanese-savvy Consoles
     "kon", "kterm", and "pxvt" will enable you to display exotic 
     looking Japanese characters on your screen, giving it a distinct
     oriental look-and-feel.
     
  2) Japanese Input Methods (or JIM for people in the know)
     "Wnn", "Canna", "SKK" and "sj3" will convert an input string 
     from standard 101/106 keyboards into Japanese characters, words, 
     phrases or symbols.
     
  3) Japanese-savvy editors 
     "jelvis" (Japanese vi clone), NEmacs (Japanese Emacs)and Mule 
     (Multilingual Emacs).
  
  4) Japanese TeX system
  
  5) Others
     "Oneko" is a cute mouse-cursor chaser for the X-window system. 
     There are several mail and news handlers, character code set
     converters and shells to handle Japanese characters in command 
     line under Linux. See section E for details.

  Binaries in JE use the EUC-J character code set as default. This 
  code set is chosen because of its popularity among UNIX 
  workstations. However, MS-DOS and other personal computers use 
  SJIS or Shift-JIS code set.  And then there is the JIS code set, 
  yet another encoding (sigh), which is widely used on the net to 
  exchange Japanese information among computer systems.
  
  Yes, it is messy.  This diversity (or chaos) derives from 
  historical and political reasons. There isn't much that developers 
  can do at the moment. Most software in JE can handle all the code 
  sets.  But, some require re-compilation to handle different code 
  sets, while some are run-time configurable.  "nkf" will detect 
  and convert among these three popular code sets.


  A-3: Requirements
  -----------------
  
  JE is designed to be installed over a standard distribution of 
  Linux such as Slackware or SLS. The current version, JE-0.9.5, 
  requires shared libraris libc-4.5.26 or newer and libX-3.1.0 or 
  greater, both of which are included in the JE1 disk set.

  As of version 0.9.5, JE no longer assumes shadow passwords.


  A-4: What's New in 0.9.5
  -----------------------
  
  The changes in 0.9.5 might be subtle in terms of content, but 
  enormous in terms of form and organization.  If you are upgrading 
  from previous versions, please be VERY careful.

  - Reorganized disk sets
  - Added a VGA only version of "gs"
  - Added "temacs" packages (pre-dumped emacs)
  - Added "je menu", "faqbro", Japanese FAQ/HOWTOs
  - Upgraded Canna (to V3.2), XFree86j/Xsi (to V2.1.1)
  - Added dviout/prt that support epsbox+gs
  - Added new packages, such as Japanese VIM, mnews, prn
  - Added "InterViews 3.1"
  - Reorganized the directory structure to something more standard
    + Changed NEmacs directory to default
      (/usr/local/lib/emacs -> /usr/local/emacs)
    + File/programs that are called from other programs are moved 
      to more standard locations (especially Tcl/Tk and "sendmail" 
      related files)
    + Fonts are moved to /usr/share/fonts directory, to avoid 
      cluttering of the TeX directory



  B. Sources of Information
  =========================

  B-0: New version of JE-HOWTO
  -------------------------------
  
  The latest version of JE-HOWTO should be available as a part of 
  the latest JE distribution, and will also be posted on 
  "fj.os.linux" and other newsgroups when it is updated.

  Please note that due to translation overhead, the English JE-HOWTO 
  may not be completely up-to-date.


  B-1: Network News
  -----------------
  
  The best place to adress general questions and discussions on JE 
  is the "fj.os.linux" newsgroup. This newsgroup is very active on 
  JE related topics. The only drawback (for you, maybe) is that the 
  majority of posts are in Japanese. Postings in other languages, 
  however, are quite welcome. English is quite OK, and you might 
  even get away with Spanish, Swahili, Vietnamese or Atlantis. 
  Mayans and Egiptian hieroglyphs require too many special fonts,
  and thus should be avoided at the moment. This may change in the
  future as JE evolves into a truely universal environment with 
  built in inter-galactic translator (development code name Babel 
  Fish).
  As of 1995, chances of your getting replies would be greatest if 
  you post either in English or in Japanese.


  B-2: Mailing List
  -----------------
  
  There is no mailing list specializing in JE at the moment. 
  However, there is the Japanese Linux Mailing List, where JE 
  related topics are actively discussed. In fact, JE is a direct 
  offspring of this ML. In addition, you may get a beta version 
  of JE by through occasional circulation in tapes or disk media.

  To join the Japanese Linux ML, send e-mail as:

       # Mail linux@colias.tutics.tut.ac.jp
       X-Mn-Cmd: join

  To obtain a brief guide about the ML, send e-mail to;

       linux@colias.tutics.tut.ac.jp

  with only "# guide" (without quotations) in its body.

  A Mailing List in English was just born. It is called jewel-ML,
  "The Mailing List of JE for the World in the English Language".
  The e-mail address is,

       jewel@colias.tutics.tut.ac.jp

  and we, JE developers and coordinators, are waiting for you with 
  a cup of coffee (or a mug of virtual beer) at hand. Please relax 
  and join us.


  B-3: Installation Guide
  -----------------------
  
  JE comes with "The Guide", an installation guide written in 
  Japanese. This explains the installation procedure step by step. 
  The current version is somewhat outdated, but it will give you 
  a very good idea of what's involved, IF you can read Japanese. 
  There is no English edition, but we are certain that whoever
  will create one should be rewarded with global praised and fame 
  and fortune, rivaled only by that of Linus Torvalds himself.
  Hmm... wonder if anybody out there might volunteer...(hint, hint!)


  B-4: Feedback
  -------------
  
  Bug reports and suggestions should be posted on the newsgroup 
  "fj.os.linux" so that it can be shared faster among various 
  interested parties.  If you don't have access, or prefer the 
  privacy of e-mail, send them to je@Roy.dsl.tutics.ac.jp. 
  Jewel-ML, mentioned in B-2, is also available for those of you
  tender souls out there. 

  Please don't send e-mail to the original developers of each 
  program in JE when you find a problem, because your problem may 
  be due to our composer's faults and we don't want to bother the 
  authors.
  
  [Translator's Note: The above notice seems to be loaded with
  the strange Japanese idea of politeness.  If you are REALLY REALLY 
  sure that there is a bug, or if you have good suggestions, I don't 
  see why you shouldn't let the original developers know about it.
  What is actually implied here is that, don't treat them like some
  sort of an on-line help or your personal slaves that you can push
  around, press demands or nag at. This will annoy them, discourage 
  further developments and enhancements.]


  B-5: Other Sources of Information
  ---------------------------------
  
  The following two documents are made public to explain Japanese 
  Linux matters. Both are written in Japanese and, unfortunately, 
  no English version is available.

  "Linux Jouhou memo" 
       by Y. Hiro Yamazaki <hiro@ice3.ori.u-tokyo.ac.jp>
       
  "JMETA-FAQ" by Tetsu Ono <ono@eiehost.gee.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

  Both are included in the doc disk set of JE. They are occasionally
  updated and posted on fj.os.linux and other BBSs in Japan.


  There is a very good book in English which will help you 
  understand how the  Japanese language is handled on computers, 
  including the mind boggling issue of the character code sets.

    Understanding Japanese Information Processing
    Ken Lunde
    O'Reilly & Associates Inc.
    ISBN 1-56592-043-0

  For other sources of Japanese processing in Unix/Linux environment,
  look for the English manpages of mule, Canna, Wnn and kinput2.
  texinfo manual of mule explains its difference from GNU Emacs, and
  /mule/etc contains FAQs in various languages.


  C. Getting JE
  =============


  C-1: Anonymous ftp
  ------------------
  
  JE is available at the following anonymous ftp sites in Japan in 
  binary form.  This is the standard distribution:
  (sites info based on JMETA-FAQ 1.32 & Linux Joho Memo 12/1/94)

                                130.158.208.193 /pub/Linux/pkg/JE/0.95

  "tutserver" is the source of JE. However, use of other sites is 
  strongly recommended since the connection to "tutserver" is rather 
  thin.

  The following sites outside Japan are known to mirror "tutserver" 
  everyday:

    sunsite.unc.edu             152.2.22.81       /pub/Linux/distributions/je
    ftp.cdrom.com               192.153.46.2      /pub/linux/je

  Source codes are available at the following sites:

    tutserver.tutcc.tut.ac.jp  133.15.64.6      /pub/linux/je-sources
    ftp.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp     130.54.23.2      /Linux/JE-sources
    ftp.huie.hokudai.ac.jp      
                      133.50.16.80      /pub/system/Jlinux/JE-sources
    ftp.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp      157.82.96.67    /pub2/Linux/je-sources
    ftp.iij.ad.jp              192.244.176.50  /pub/linux-j/JE-sources
    ftp.pu-toyama.ac.jp        133.55.2.15       /pub/Linux/JE-sources

  Linux patches (if any) are separated from its original. So, when 
  you get to the above sites, you may see something like the 
  following;

       oneko-1.1b.tar.Z            Original codes
       oneko-1.1b+lx.diff.gz       Linux patch

  The files with extensions "+lx", "+je" are the Linux patches. If 
  there are any other patches, apply them before applying the 
  Linux/JE patches.


  C-2: CD-ROM
  -----------

  JE is also available in CD-ROM:

       CD-ROM Shop Laser5
       Big Office Plaza, Suite 203
       2-652-8 Higashi Ikebukuro
       Toshima-ku,
       170 Tokyo Japan

       Phone: +81-3-5952-4639
       FAX:   +81-3-5952-7486

  This CD-ROM contains JE with its source codes as well as 
  Slackware and SLS distributions. The organizers are active 
  members of Japanese Linux ML. So, the CD-ROM reflects the 
  feedback from Japanese users quickly.

  Unfortunately, this distributor does not accept overseas orders.


  A number of other CD-ROMs include JE.  These include (but not
  limited to):

  Unfortunately JE is not an indispensable component of the Linux
  distribution (yet), and on each release, distributors include 
  it or exclude it depending on capacities and whims. So check 
  before you buy.
  

  D. Installation
  ===============

  This section explains the installation procedure of JE. Remember 
  that you must have Linux already installed before you tamper 
  with JE!

  The custom installer called "ezinst" is in the JE disk set of JE. 
  Use "pkgtool" of Slackware or "sysinstall" of SLS in your system 
  to install ezinst itself.


  D-1: Getting Ready
  ------------------

  1) Prepare Floppy Disks of JE.
 
    Copy each directory to a disk. Each disk set of JE should fit 
    on a High Density floppy disk, 5" or 3.5" 2HD. This step is 
    not necessary if you install JE from HDD or CD-ROM, or via NFS.


  2) Check the Version of the Libraries.
 
    To do this, use the "ldconfig" command. The result should look 
    something like this;


        # ldconfig -p
        9 libs found in cache `/etc/ld.so.cache' (version 1.4.3)
                 1 - /lib/libvga.so.1.0.11
                 2 - /usr/X11/lib/libtk.so.3.1
                 3 - /usr/lib/libtcl.so.3.1
                 4 - /lib/libm.so.4.5.24
                 5 - /lib/libc.so.4.5.24
                 6 - /usr/X11/lib/libXt.so.3.1.0
                 7 - /lib/libXpm.so.3.3.0
                 8 - /usr/X11/lib/libXaw.so.3.1.0
                 9 - /usr/X11/lib/libX11.so.3.1.0

    Write down the versions of #4,5,6,8,9 (libc.so, libm.so, 
    libXt.so, libXaw.so, libX11.so). In the above case, these 
    would be 4.5.24 and 3.1.0.



  D-2: Installing the Installer (ezinst)
  --------------------------------------

  1) Installing from Floppy Disks
 
     Stick the JE1 disk in the drive. Start "pkgtool" by typing:

        # pkgtool

     Your machine will ask you what you are installing from. Choose;
 
        Floppy   Install packages from floppy disks

    You'll be prompted for the disk type. Write down the device name 
    of the disk that you assigned here.
   
    Next, you'll be prompted for a series name.  Answer "JE".  Now, 
    proceed to 3).
 
 
  2) Installing from Non-Floppies
  
     The source media must be recognized by Linux as a mounted 
     directory.
  
  a. Installation from a Pre-mounted Directory
  
     cd to the JE1 directory. Now, start pkgtool;

        # pkgtool

     And then, select the following as the installation source:
    
        Current  Install packages from the current directory

     Now, proceed to (3).

  
  b. Installing from an NFS Server
  
     Mount the NFS server disk.  For example, suppose JE1 is 
     located on the /home1/ftp/Linux/JE directory on an NFS server 
     named zephyrus.  You should type;

        # mount zephyrus:/home1/ftp/Linux/JE /mnt

     Then, you should find the directory /mnt/JE1. Move to this 
     directory using cd. Now, start pkgtool;

        # pkgtool

     And then, select the following as the installation source:
    
        Current  Install packages from the current directory

     Now, proceed to 3).


  c. Installing from CD-ROM
 
     Mount the CD-ROM.  If you installed Slackware and have already 
     configured your CD-ROM drive, you should type as follows:

        # mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt

     If not, determine the device name to mount using the following 
     list;
 
        /dev/sr0   : SCSI CD-ROM
        /dev/mcd   : Mitsumi CD-ROM
        /dev/sbpcd : SB CD-ROM
        /dev/cdu31a: CDU31A CD-ROM
        /dev/sonycd: SONY CD-ROM


     After mounting, you should find the directory /mnt/JE1. Move 
     there using cd, and write down the device name that you used 
     here. Now, start pkgtool;

        # pkgtool

     And then, select the following as the installation source:
    
        Current  Install packages from the current directory

     Now, proceed to 3).

  
  
  3) Installing JE1
  
     The JE1 disk contains the following packages:

     ezinst:   Easy installer for JE
     konbin:   KON to display Kanji on console
     konfnt:   Fonts for kon (the same as those for Minix/V)
     libc:     Linux standard shared libraries
     libx:     XFree86 shared libraries (English version)

     "libc" and "libx" included here are libc-4.5.26 and libX-3.1.0. 
     Compare these with what you currently have (you wrote them down 
     at D-1 2)!). If you have a newer version, fine.  Otherwise, 
     copy and use the libraries included in this disk.

     If you want Japanese messages during the installation, you 
     need "kon" or any software that can display Japanese and is 
     supported by the curses.

     Now, your installer is ready and at your service.



  D-3: Installing the Real Thing
  ------------------------------

  1) Run your terminal software, such as "kon" for console:

        # kon

     If your machine is the Toshiba J3100SX, you may use Kanji-term 
     for J3100 as well as kon with j3100 option:

        # kon j3100sx

     The installer uses "/var/adm/mount" to temporary mount floppy 
     disks or CD-ROMs. Thus, if you already have something mounted 
     there, you should unmount it NOW.

     If you want Japanese messages during installation, type:

        # ezinst -j

    If you'd rather have English messages, type:

        # ezinst -e



  2) Follow the instructions by ezinst.  The general procedure will 
     be as follows;

        (1) Choose which package to install
        (2) Choose where to install from
        (3) Let ezinst do the rest!

     The actual menu will look like the follows, when you chose 
     the -e option (for the menus in -j option, please refer to the 
     Japanese version of this HOWTO).

  (1) Choose the Packages
  
      Here, you will choose which packages to install. The most
      crucial choice would be the choice of your input method and
      your Emacs. Crucial, because it will largely determine your
      psychosomatic relation with the system.
      
      The choice of Japanese input method is largely a matter of 
      taste and religion. JE provides four flavors: SKK, Wnn, Canna, 
      and sj3. You can't install Wnn, Canna, and sj3 together. They 
      are mutually exclusive. Install the one that best suits your 
      twisted perversions and/or worship. It is said that conservative 
      Bhuddists tend to prefer Wnn, while VooDooist militant sects
      favor canna, but heretics are everywhere.
      
      But seriously, their differences can be summarized as follows;
      
      Wnn: Has the largest user base. It can also handle Korean and 
           Chinese.  Requires on the server resources.
      Canna: Less demanding on the system, and easier to customize.
             Better for stand-alone use.
      sj3: Very compact. Suited for people with limited disk space.

      The bogus size of JE is partly due to this diversity; each 
      method (and even no method) requires a different set of Emacs! 
      We just HAD o have 'em all.

      The choice of Emacs is also a matter of taste. You need one of 
      X or non-X version of Emacs that matches the input method of 
      your choice. Mule (multi-lingual Emacs) has more features than 
      NEmacs (Japanese Emac), but it takes up more disk space. 
      So, a desktop PC user may reside in the nirvana of Canna-Mule 
      on her X window system, while a laptop user may find solace in 
      non-X NEmacs with SKK.

      Anyway, once you make the major decisions, the installer will 
      largely determine which packages to install (we call this "the
      Standard Rule"), since it knows the dependency among packages 
      to some extent.


      (1a.1) Choose Using Standard Rules
             Based on your general selection, the installer will 
             take care of all the details.  For example, every input 
             method (Wnn, Canna, sj3) need their own dictionary and 
             tools. Installer knows this, and automatically installs 
             them according to your choice.

      (1a.2) Choose Manually
             If you want to do some unusual or esoteric installation, 
             this menu will allow you to taketotal control over the 
             installation. You should know exactly what you're doing.
             Instead of starting from scratch, we suggest that you 
             first let the installer do the standard file selection, 
             and then customize it using the manual option.
     
      (1b) Load Package List
             Instead of choosing packages one by one, you can load a 
             package list file (if you have one).


  (2) Assign Installation Source
      Tell the installer where you are installing from. If you've 
      just installed JE1, and if you're not using floppies, you 
      should find the subdirectory JE1 under /tmp. In this case, 
      you can use method (2.2).

      (2.1) Install from Floppy Disks
             Type the device name of the floppy drive that you wrote 
             down in D-2 1).

      (2.2) Install from Mounted Directory
             Type the directory that contains the JE1 subdirectory. 
             For instance, if you have:
     
                 /mnt/JE/JE1 

             you should type:

                 /mnt/JE


      (2.3) Mount an NFS Server and Install
             Type the name of the NFS server, and the directory 
             that contains the JE1 subdirectory. For instance, if 
             you are installing from an NFS server named  zephyrus 
             with the directory:

                 /home1/ftp/Linux/JE/JE1
 
             you should input:

                 zephyrus
                 /home1/ftp/Linux/JE

      (2.4) Mount a Device (CD-ROM) and Install
             Type the device name, file system type, and the 
             directory that contains the JE1 subdirectory.
              For CD-ROMs, the device name is what you wrote down 
              at D-2 2) (c), and the file system type is iso9660.


  (3) Installation Menu
      Finally, we are ready to start the actual installation... but 
      not quite.  Do yourself a favor and give it a final check.

      (3.1) Check the Required Disks
             When you choose this menu, the installer will give you 
             a list of the required disks.  Do you have them all?

      (3.2) Check Packages to Install
             The installer will display what package it will install.

      (3.3) Check Installation Source Directory
             If you're not installing from floppy disks, Choose this 
             menu. It will display the contents of the source 
             directory.  Make sure that they are correct.

      (3.4) Start Installation
             Finally (finally!), choose this menu and you are going!
             If you're using floppies, the installer will prompt you 
             for the disks. Obey it. You can make up to 3 mistakes 
             for each disk.


  (4) Save Preference
      Saves the current preferences (Language for the messages, and 
      the installation source) to a file.



  3) After the installation, when you quit ezinst, it will ask you:

        Save selected list ? (y/n)

     Choosing "y" will create a package list.  You can use this list 
     to re-install JE at a later time. To do this, re-start 
     ezinstall and choose the file at (1b).



  D-4: Installation Tips
  -------------------------
  
  ¥ If you're installing for the first time, getting all the files 
    right manually can be quite cumbersome. Let the installer do 
    the job, and then modify it.
    
  ¥ JE does not assume the use of shadow passwords anymore.
  
  ¥ If you are installing from floppy disks, you could minimize your 
    labor (and the number of disks) by taking the following steps:

    (1) Make ONLY the JE1 disk and install it.
    (2) Start ezinst, and choose the packages.
    (3) From the "Install Menu", choose "Check the Required Disks" 
        and write down which disks you will be needing.
    (4) Open another virtual console.  Or, close ezinst and save the 
        package list.
    (5) From the new console, create the necessary disks.
    (6) Go back to the ezinst. Or, if you've closed ezinst, re-start 
        it and load the package list.
    (7) Go on with the installation.
    
    
    This way, you won't have to make disks for packages that you 
    are not going to use.

  E. Contents of each disk set
  ============================
  
  The current JE (v.0.9.5) consists of 55 disks, which are divided

      widely used under MS-DOS especially in Japan, "pf" is a print 
      tool for Japanese line printers.
 
  (2) "jless" is a Japanese pager, which automatically detects the 
      character code set in the document and converts it to the code
      used in the display by refering to the environment variable 
      LESSCHARSET. Most Japanese Linuxers set this variable as 
      "japanese-ujis".

  (3) "pcurses" is a curses with a Japanese handling feature.

  (4) "jman" is a manpage system with Japanese nroff. It enables you 
      to look up Japanese manpages.

      JIS, SJIS, or UJIS code set which might have lost some 
      information through network transfers or by other accidents.

  (7) "jelvis" is Japanese elvis (vi clone), while "ng" a subset of 
      Japanese Emacs. Use them with "uum", "canuum" or "kinput2" to 
      input Japanese characters.

      which is less demanding. Both are capable of handling 
      English documents, too.

  (2) "dviout" is a DVI previewer for VGA, while "dviprt" is a 
      printer driver; both are ported from their DOS versions, 
      which work under non-X environments. They are based on 
      version 2.39 of dviout/prt. The lates release is psbox+gs
      savvy.

  (3) "jdvi2kps" converts DVI files into Japanese PostScript files.
  
  (4) "4up" is a filter that takes Japanese Postscript files, and 
      shrinks 2 (or 4) pages into a single page.

  (5) "pl2bin" is a Plain-text-to-TeX/roff filter. "pl2doc" is its
      documentation.

  (6) "fntuty" is a utility to convert between bitmap, PK, and 
      vector fonts.

  Note that DVI previewer for X environment is in the jx disk set 
  for X applications.


  E-10: font disk set
  -------------------
  
  This disk set contains bitmap and vector fonts for Japanese TeX 
  and the X window system. Note that Japanese PK fonts are NOT 
  necessary if you decide to go with vector fonts.

    cmf180:   180dpi-PK Computer Modern font for TeX
    vmincho1: Zeit vector font in Mincho (JIS level 1 kanjis)
    vmincho2: Zeit vector font in Mincho (JIS level 2 kanjis)
    vasiya1:  Zeit vector font in Round Gothic (JIS L1 kanjis)
    vasiya2:  Zeit vector font in Round Gothic (JIS L1 kanjis)
    vhokuto:  Zeit vector font in Brush typeface
    xfnt13:   13 dot alphabet and Kana font for X
    xfnt16:   16 dot Japanese fonts for X
    xfnt18:   18 dot Japanese fonts for X
    xfnt24:   24 dot Japanese fonts for X
    xfnt26:   26 dot Japanese fonts for X
    xmarufnt: Round typeface Japanese font for X

  (1) TeX requires Computer Modern fonts "cmf180". Depending on the 
      resolution of your printer, other CM fonts might be needed. 
      In that case, you have to find them on the net or create them 
      yourself using the Metafont system.

  (2) "vmincho1/2", "vasiya1/2", and "vhokuto" are Zeit compatible 
      vector fonts for TeX (dviout/prt, xdvi) and Japanese 
      Ghostscript. You can buy the original Zeit font from Zeit, 
      or you can get free alternatives here in JE.

  (3) "xfnt??" and "xmarufnt" are Japanese fonts for the X-window 
     system. Make sure to execute mkfontdir in 
     /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc after you install any of them.

  * As of JE-0.9.5, bitmap fonts for Japanese TeX are no longer 
    supported.  Only vector fonts are supported.


  E-11: xclt disk set
  -----------------

  This is a collection of X applications.

    xfntali: fonts.alias for Kanji Fonts
    k14:     the famous 14 dot Kanji fonts for X
    kterm:   kterm-5.2.0, xterm with Kanji support
    pxvt:    small Japanese terminal emulator for X, based on rxvt
    xldimg:  image file viewer for X
    oneko:   a cat chasing your mouse cursor
    libtk:   Tcl7.3Tk3.6jp (library)
    tkbin:   Tcl7.3Tk3.6jp (binary)
    tkdemo:  Tcl7.3Tk3.6jp (demo)
    tkman:   Tcl7.3Tk3.6jp (manual)
    xdvi:    DVI previewer with Zeit vector font support
    jgsx11:  Japanese Ghostscript for X11/VGA
    gview:   ghostview-1.5 (X interface for Ghostscript)
    tgif:    tgif-2.13.2.j ( a draw tool with Japanese support)
    xklock:  screen lock with Kanji support

  (1) "k14" is a set of Japanese fonts contributed to the X-window 
      system. You may find it even on your English-only workstations 
      in your office, since it is included in the core distribution 
      of X.

  (2) "xengine" is an application to evaluate the performance of an 
      X server.

  (3) "oneko" makes it easy to find your mouse cursor; a neko (a 
      Japanese word for cat) chases your mouse on your screen. You 
      can turn it into a dog chasing a bone.

  (4) "tkbin", "libtk", "tkdemo", and "tkman" are components of
      Japanese Tcl/Tk. GUI development with Japanese messages is a 
      breeze with these tools.

  (5) "tgif" is the drawing tool with kinput2 interface to 
      input Japanese strings. It can handle EPS files as well as 
      its proprietary  files.
 

  E-12: xsi disk set
  -------------------

  This disk set contains internationalized XFree86-2.1.1 using the 
  Xsi extension. Fonts not included.

    xfs3.tgz:     S3 server
    xfsvga.tgz:   SVGA server
    xfvga16.tgz:  VGA16 server
    xf8514.tgz:   8514 server
    xfmach32.tgz: Mach32 server
    xfmach8.tgz:  Mach8 server
    xfmono.tgz:   VGA Mono server
    fvwm:         Fast, compact and clean window manager
    xfbin.tgz:    basic clients
    xfprog.tgz:   programming kit
    xflib.tgz:    shared libraries and other support files
    xfxaklib:     Shared library for Internationalized Xaw, kinput2 
                  version
    xfxawlib:     Shared library for Internationalized Xaw, xwnmo 
                  version (default)
    xfxakprg:     Internationalized Xaw Programming Kit, kinput2 
                  version
    xfxawprg:     Internationalized Xaw Programming Kit, xwnmo 
                  version (default)
    xfwchprg:     Xwchar Programming Kit
    xfxainc:      Include file for Internationalized Xaw
    xwmno:        Japanese input system
    xmh:          Interfaces for MH X version
    xwkterm:      kterm for XWNMO
    xinfo:        GNU info file viewer
    xcal          Calendar & Scheduler application
    xpbiff:       xbiff with pop-up animation
    xgopher:      Japanese gopher client
    
  This disk set was prepared through the following steps.

    - Based on XFree86-2.1.1
    - Set Xsi, X_LOCALE, X_WCHAR and XML, and did "make World"
    - Merged Xawk2 and Xwchar into Xaw-i18n (xfxaklib)

  xfxawlib will enable the use of xwnmo (default) for Japanese 
  input.  Xaw will be able to handle Japanese by installing 
  xfxawlib.tgz.
  
  xaxaklib will enable the use of Japanese characters on 
  internationalized clients such as xcal-i18n through kinput2. 
  Xaw will be able to handle Japanese by installing xfxawlib.tgz.
  
  To summarize;
    - xaw* -> xwnmo version (default)
    - xak* -> kinput2 version
  You need to pick one and install it. However, by switching the
  shared library, you can go back and forth between xwnmo and 
  kinput2.

  "XFree86-j" is upward-compatible with the original XFree86. 
  Non-internationalized clients will run without problem. Moreover,
  the binaries might improve your X system, because XFree86-j 
  includes the latest patches. 
  
  However, please note that this package is NOT complete. It does
  not include the fonts and the manuals. You need to install it 
  over the original XFree86.
  
  Xsi version of XFree86 still hasn't gone through intensive
  tests. Thus, unknown problems might exist.


  E-13: iv disk set
  -----------------------
  
  This disk set contains the Japanese InterViews 3.1.  The shared 
  library version still has problems, so this set is based on the 
  static link version.

    ivdevel:   Japanese InterViews 3.1 Include files etc.
    ivlib1:    Japanese InterViews 3.1 Static Library
    ivlib2:    Japanese InterViews 3.1 Class Library
    ivman:     Japanese InterViews 3.1 manual
    ivprog:    Development tools for Japanese InterViews 3.1
    ivdemos:   Japanese InterViews 3.1 Demos
    doc:       WYSIWYG TeX, DTP Tools
    idraw:     Japanese InterViews 3.1 Draw tools
    ibuild:    Japanese InterViews/Unidraw 3.1 Interface Builder
    ibsample:  Samples for ibuild
        


  F. Future Plans
  ==============
  
  We plan to improve the following aspects of JE.

  1) More and better documentation:
  
      Works of JF (Japanese FAQ project: The Japanese version of
      Linux Documentation Project) members will be made available 
      in the doc disk set. 
      Translation of major HOWTOs, Japanese FAQs and others are on
      their way. (And of course, English documents, too..)


  2) More Software Packages:

      Various software packages will be included as they come.


  3) XFree86 with Ximp extensions:
 
     Some people prefer Ximp to Xsi, another implementation of 
    internationalized X.


  4) Migration to Other Platforms:
  
  
  5) Kernel Source Packages
  
     106-Keyboard support, spc drivers, etc.


  6)Evolution toward Multilingual Extensions:
  
   Give us your opinions! JE developers are not specialists in all 
   languages.


  JE was originally compiled as an extension of the SLS distribution 
  of Linux, but the developers are leaning heavily toward Slackware
  these days.



  G. JE Counter
  =============
  
  I am curious as to who uses JE for what, and who actually uses
  this English How-To. Japanese speakers/writers in Japan will obviously
  benefit from JE itself, but they won't need any English docs. So,
  who needs this English JE HOWTO?
  
  If you use JE, or even just brousing through this document, could
  you tell me where you are using/reading this, and what you are up
  to with JE? I won't set any formats, because honestly, I'm not sure
  what to expect. Please send your response to:
  
        Hiroo YAMAGATA     <hiyori13@interramp.com>

  I'll try to include the results in the future versions of this
  HOWTO. TNX!
