Linux and the SoundBlaster AWE64 PnP

So you finally sprung for that bitchin SB AWE64 PNP?? Cool deal. Now
you wanna configure it?! HAHAH GOOD LUCK!! Just kidding. 

PnP Configuration

First thing's first. We're going to take care of the PnP-ness (hhehe
say that fast :) of the card. Inever had luck with the new PnP driver
in Linux, so I'm not even going to talk about it here other than to
say don't use it. Since we can't use the driver and we're too lazy to
boot to DOS, blah, blah, we need to use isapnptools. Here's the URL: 

      ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/pnp/utils/isapnptools-1.10.tgz 

Got it? Good. Untar it, compile it, install it. READ ALL THE
DOCUMENTATION!! Done? Good. Now do this: 

      bash$ pnpdump > pnpconf 

That will dump all of the possible settings for all of the ISA PnP
cards in your system. Now you have to edit that file so that it
identifies what devices you want to use. Now would be a good time to
go back and READ ALL THE DOCUMENTATION!! if you didn't before. If you
need a clue, here's what mine looks like, with all the comments removed: 

(READPORT 0x0203)
(ISOLATE)
(IDENTIFY *)

(CONFIGURE CTL009d/268451217 (LD 0
(INT 0 (IRQ 5 (MODE +E)))
(DMA 0 (CHANNEL 1))
(DMA 1 (CHANNEL 5))
(IO 0 (BASE 0x0220))
(IO 1 (BASE 0x0330))
(IO 2 (BASE 0x0388))
(ACT Y)
))

(CONFIGURE CTL009d/268451217 (LD 1
(IO 0 (BASE 0x0200))
))

(CONFIGURE CTL009d/268451217 (LD 2
(IO 0 (BASE 0x0620))
(IO 1 (BASE 0x0A20))
(IO 2 (BASE 0x0E20))
(ACT Y)
))

(CONFIGURE CTL009d/268451217 (LD 3
))

Looks real pretty, eh? Don't sweat it.

LD 0 is the SoundBlaster. 

      IRQ: 5 DMA: 1 16bit DMA: 5 PORT: 220 MIDI: 330. 

LD 2 is the AWE synthesizer. 

      PORT: 620. 

LD 1 is the Game/Joystick Port and LD 3 is the IDE port on the card. 

Now, move this file someplace handy. I put it in /etc/isapnp.conf. Now
you can configure your PNP devices with isapnp. 

      bash$ isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf 

If you still need help my /etc/isapnp.conf is at
http://www.i-plus.net/~nega/linux/isapnp.conf.

Kernel Configuration

AWE support in the stock soundblaster driver isn't very good, so we're
going to go get a new one (AWE driver that is).
 http://bahamut.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~iwai/awedrv/ is the AWE driver
homepage. Go there, because you're going to get really familiar with
it. Get the driver. Here's the URL: 

      http://bahamut.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~iwai/awedrv/awedrv-0.4.0.tgz 

Put it somewhere handy (I put it in /usr/src) and unarchive it. CD
into its directory. Now, READ THE DOCUMENTATION!! Finished? Good. Run
install.sh and answer any questions it asks you. 

      bash$ sh install.sh 

Now, all you have to do is rebuild your kernel and modules, and you're
all set! Be sure you include "AWE synth" under "Low Level Drivers" of
the "Sound Configuration" section. If you dont know how to rebuild
your kernel, the go read the Kernel-HOWTO. In fact, read it a couple
of times. 

Hints and Further Help

Put isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf into one of your boot files. (Mine is in
/etc/rc.d/rc.local). Read everything on the AWE Driver Homepage and
get your software and software patches rom there. Trust me. It will
make the use of your card much more enjoyable.  

If you still need help configuring your Soundblaster AWE64 PnP, or
just want to talk about Linux stuff feel free to email me at
nega@vt.edu. Alternativly, you can find me on EFnet IRC as tryst on
#linux.
