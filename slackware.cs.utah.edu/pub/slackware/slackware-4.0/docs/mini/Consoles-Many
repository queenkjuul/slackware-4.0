Efficiently using more than 8 consoles (v1.1 15.09.96)
------------------------------------------------------

Are you tired of typing in password and username whenever you want to
access a unused text-console? Then this mini-HOWTO is for you!

All the functionallity for using a new text-console without logging in
is concentrated in the program `open'. Just issue

        open -sl

and you will be teleported to a fresh console with your favourite
shell prompting at you. Possibly this program is not part of your
distribution, but read on.

Most distributions provide only 8 console-devices. You can easily
exceed this number while playing around with `open' so it's better to
create a little stock of console-devices.


Create the nesassary device-files
---------------------------------

Log in as root. Then execute the following commands

	-----8<----- cut here -----8<-----
	cd /dev
	./MAKEDEV tty9
	for i in  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
	do
		./MAKEDEV tty1$i
	done
	-----8<----- cut here -----8<-----

`/dev/MAKEDEV' is a shell-script. You can use `more' (or `less') to
view the contents of this script to get more information about what
happens.

Of course running more than 2 login-prompts on your system is
luxuriantly when using `open'.


Get rid of all login-prompts but 2
----------------------------------

Load the file `/etc/inittab' into your favorite editor and comment out
all lines containing "getty" like shown below (hint: leave the rest of
the file unchanged!).
As you may have guessed, the char to make comments is `#'.

	-----8<----- cut here -----8<-----
	# /sbin/getty invocations for the runlevels.
	#
	# The "id" field MUST be the same as the last
	# characters of the device (after "tty").
	#
	# Format:
	#  <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>
	1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 9600 tty1
	2:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 9600 tty2
	#3:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 9600 tty3
	#4:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 9600 tty4
	#5:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 9600 tty5
	#6:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 9600 tty6
	#7:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 9600 tty7
	-----8<----- cut here -----8<-----

Re-load the above configuration-file via the command `/sbin/telinit q'
(as root ) and wipe out all running login-prompts with `killall getty'
(or whatever sort of getty you're running; you can see them with 
`ps -aux').


If you have your X-Session on vt8 (thats the console you change to
when you press Ctrl-Alt-F8 ), you may wish to add the option `vt8' to
the options for X in `/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers':

	-----8<----- cut here -----8<-----
	:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X vt8
	-----8<----- cut here -----8<-----

(Leave the rest of the file unchanged.) Voila, X is still on vt8 next
time you boot Linux. Otherwise you would have found it on vt3.


Install the program `open'
--------------------------

If the program `open' is not part of you distribution (Debian and
RedHat provide it) then get the packet "dynamic-vt-1.1.tar.gz" from
sunsite or it's mirrors.  
It contains `open' and a few other useful utilities; the installation
is straightforward.

You don't know how what "sunsite and it's mirrors" means? You don't
know how to install a program?
Sorry, that's beyond the scope of this mini-howto. It really makes me
sick to see every HOWTO explaining this again and again (making it
long and very boring). Ask an expert and write an
`Software-Installation HOWTO' afterwards. Thank you.


Test it out
-----------

You're done. Log into one console. Now, if you want to start a
command-prompt (`bash', `tcsh') on an empty console just type 

        open -sl
 
No login-id, no password is required (because you have already
authenticated yourself by logging in to one console).

Alternativly, you can try the commands

	open -sl -- top
	open -l  -- tail -f /var/log/messages
        open -sl -- pine


If the screen is still messed up, try the command `reset' or reboot the
computer once.

The consoles no. 13-24 can be accessed with <AltGr-F1> till
<AltGr-F12>.
Programs like `tty', `ps' and `chvt' help you to navigate through the
new bunch of consoles. 

Note: your sessions don't show up under `w' or `finger'.
