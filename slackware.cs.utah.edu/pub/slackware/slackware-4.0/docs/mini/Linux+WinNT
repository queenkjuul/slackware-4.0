The Linux+WindowsNT mini-HOWTO

  "You hear maniacal laughter..."
  
  Due to hardware or software problems or user headroom, I pulled my
  hair out for several days trying to get both NT and Linux happily
  settled on my new HP Vectra PC at work.

  Under no circumstances run the Disk Administrator from NT 3.51 to
  format partitions.  It asks if it can write a signature "which will
  cause absolutely no harm."  When it did this, it hosed my partition
  table until fixed by steps 3 and 7 below.  Because of these
  problems, I was limited to one FAT NT partition.  Also remember that
  even if you do get the Disk Administrator to work, you'll want at
  least one small FAT partition to use as a staging area for
  exchanging files between Linux and NT until Linux has an NTFS
  filesystem.

  I installed Linux first and then NT, but based on my experience, I
  might now be able to install NT first and then Linux.

  Note that step 6 is pertinent only to the following setup: Debian
  Linux 1.1, Linux 2.0.0, HP Vectra XU 6/150, Adaptec AIC 7880 Ultra
  (BIOS 1.2S-HP), Quantum Fireball 1080S, Phoenix compatibility BIOS
  GG.06.02.  NT 3.51.  The examples show a SCSI disk (/dev/sda);
  substitute /dev/hda for your IDE drives.

  
  1. Install a minimal Linux (hold off on installing the rest until
  you win the Linux/NT battle).  Do all your disk partitioning in
  Linux, including your NT partition (make it FAT).  I was not
  successful at making more than one NT partition.  I also made it the
  first partition, but I don't know if that is essential or not.
  
  2. Edit /etc/lilo.conf and use boot=/dev/sda (I was not successful
  at installing LILO on the Linux partition--/dev/sda3 in my case) and
  run "lilo".  You'll have to use the editor ae.  You'll live.

  3. Save the MBR with this: dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 count=1
  Use a floppy.  Trust me.  Also do this each time you change the disk
  partition table.

  4. Install NT, part 1.  When it goes to reboot halfway through the
  process you'll boot into Linux.
  
  5. Add NT stanza to /etc/lilo.conf, e.g.:
  
	other=/dev/sda1
	label=NT
	table=/dev/sda

  and run lilo.  If lilo complains about this (I forget the message),
  add the "linear" flag to /etc/lilo.conf near the "compact" keyword.
  Furthermore, if your partition table is screwed up by NT you'll
  either need to use "ignore-table" or follow the directions in Step 7.
  See also "fix-table".  The LILO HOWTO is your friend.
  
  6. Reboot, select NT from LILO, and finish NT install.  You'll need
  the "Boot Disk XU, HP Vectra AIC 7880 Driver A.01.02" floppy to
  install the ethernet drivers and the "XU/VT Drivers and
  Documentation" CD (directory video/disk4 if I recall correctly) to
  install the video drivers for the Matrox MGA Millennium.
  
  7. Back to Linux, run fdisk and ensure you don't get "partition
  doesn't end on cylinder boundary" on your Linux partitions.  You'll
  still have this error on the NT partition though, but this seems to
  be OK.
  
/dev/sda1            1        1      322   329301    6  DOS 16-bit >=32M
Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary:
     phys=(321, 39, 9) should be (321, 63, 32)

  Cfdisk reports strangeness, but it seems OK:

                                          Unusable                      0.04*
 /dev/sda1                 Primary        DOS 16-bit >=32Mb           321.59*
                                          Unusable                      0.39*

  If you do get the cylinder boundary warning on your Linux
  partitions, it is sufficient to use cfdisk to do something innocuous
  like changing the boot sector.
  
  If, however, NT has really screwed you over and cfdisk can't even
  run, complaining that it cannot open /dev/sda, then you'll need to
  take more extreme action.  You'll need that MBR you saved
  previously.  Clear and restore the MBR (but not the signature) with:

	  dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1
	  dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/dev/sda bs=510 count=1

  8.  Install the rest of Linux.  Easy, huh?

  If you prefer to have NT write the MBR instead of LILO, you may have
  to resort to the following to clear the MBR first:
  
  a) dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=446 count=1 (in Linux) or perform
     a low-level format with the SCSI utilities.  I've heard that a
     low-level format of an IDE disk is fatal, so don't do it.
  b) fdisk /mbr (you've obviously already created a DOS boot disk that
     contains fdisk).
  c) delete NT partition and create it again in NT install.
  d) continue with NT install.

  Epilogue: After first posting this message, I heard from several
  folks that they had no problems with NT's Disk Administrator, and
  were able to install either NT or Linux first without any problems.
  Hopefully, you'll be in this camp, but if not, perhaps this campfire
  story will be of some use.

  Since the first edition of this mini-HOWTO, others have written
  similar documents as well.  Please be sure to consult them.  If your
  experience differs from any presented, then you should submit your
  own mini-HOWTO or submit a revised version of this document to the
  HOWTO maintainer (reference this sentence) and send a carbon copy to
  me as I don't have the time to maintain this document.  Someone
  should eventually combine all of these documents into a single
  coherent HOWTO.

  Finally, I'm afraid this document details all I know about this
  subject.  I should point you to an appropriate Linux newsgroup for
  further information.  I use NT about one day a year.  Under duress.
