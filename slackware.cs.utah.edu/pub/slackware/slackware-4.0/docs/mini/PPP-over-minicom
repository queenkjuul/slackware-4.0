---------------------------                  v0.0  09 December 1996

You want a menu-driven tool for dealing with PPP? An easy but powerful
database with telephone numbers of your ISP? Want to see what happens
when logging in? Then this mini-HOWTO is for you!


  1. Introduction

        PPP has become the standard network protocol for hooking up
        to the internet via dial-in connections. The associated
        daemon "pppd" ships with a very primitive tool for dialing
        which handles only very simple setups well.
        I will describe an alternate solution on the basis of "minicom".

        This document is a short version of the German "Internetanbindung
        mit PPP" ("http://www.uni-koeln.de/themen/linux/ppp/")


  1.1. The terminal program "minicom"

        "minicom" is a very sophisticated tool for dialing into
        other computers (ISPs or BBSs). It has a fancy colored menu,
        a telephone database and a powerful scripting language. Thus
        it is ideally suited for use in conjunction with "pppd".

        BTW, if you run "/sbin/mgetty /dev/modem" everyone with a
        valid account on your machine can dial in (e.g. using
        "minicom"). But thats another story. Please see the docs of
        "mgetty" for details.


  1.2. Feedback

        I'm only interested in feedback that improves this mini-HOWTO.
        I won't answer general questions about Linux, PPP, SLIP or
        networking.


  1.3. Known bugs

        At the time of writing, there seem to be some bugs in
        "minicom", "runscript" and the method described below:

              - "runscript" does not wait for external programs to
                finish 

                        print "blah"
                        ! sleep 10
                        print "blup"

                This script exits immediatly (but not when straced
                ...)

              - "pppd" takes the serial device away from minicom
                (when not fed via stdin)


        It seems that Miquel van Smoorenburg (the author of minicom)
        is too busy to get his fingers on the above. So volunteers
        are welcome.



  2.0. Dialing with minicom

        Many guides on PPP recommend to leave minicom after it's been
        used for dialing. But there is really no need to leave this
        comfortable program ...


  2.1. Configure minicom

        Execute "minicom -s" and choose the menu item "Serial port
        setup". The first entry should be "Serial Device" this is
        the most important setting: the serial device your
        modem is attached to. (Any volunteers to mess up minicom to
        handle several serial devices at once?)
        Press <return> to confirm and <esc> to exit to the initial
        setup menu. Choose "Exit to minicom" and type "atdt99999".
        Your modem should start to dial immediatly and you should
        hear a click when the modem hooks up to the line. Of course
        "99999" is no valid telephone number.


  2.2. Starting PPP manually

        Maybe you've already tried to dial the telephone number of
        your ISP instead of "99999". Did you see funny characters
        on the screen after login in (if not, type "ppp")? They
        result from the "pppd" (or equivalent) started at the other
        end of the line. If so you can try to start the
        "pppd"-daemon on your side and evaluate the log-files
        afterwards.

        To start "pppd" inside minicom, you can define a new
        upload method (figure out yourself) or re-define the
        setting "kermit programm" from the configuration menu
        "Filename and paths":

                A - Download directory :
                B -   Upload directory :
                C -   Script directory :
                D -     Script program : /usr/bin/runscript
                E -     Kermit program : /usr/sbin/pppd file /etc/ppp/mini_options

        Now if you see those funny characters next time you dial
        to your ISP you can press <Alt-K> to start "pppd".

        The rest of this mini-HOWTO deals with automating the task
        of logging in and starting "pppd".


  2.3. Evaluating logfiles

        Although I do not want to explain how PPP is to be configured,
        I give a short tip how to read the log-file. To extract the
        essential information from the logfile "/var/log/debug" (or
        alternative "/var/log/daemon.log") execute the commands

                tail -n 40  /var/log/debug |\
                        grep -E " pppd\[[0-9]*\]:" |\
                        sed -e "s/^.*pppd\[/[/" 

        You should see messages like

                sent [LCP ConfReq id=0x1 <mru 296>]
                rcvd [LCP ConfRej id=0x1 <mru 296>]

        which indicate that we sent a config-request to set the maximum
        recieve unit (mru) to 296. The other side refects this setting
        ("configuration rejected"). In this case I just removed the
        option "mru" from "/etc/ppp/options" (see below).


  2.4. Configure a telephone number

        If the above was successful you may want to store a telephone
        number in minicoms database. Press <Alt-D> to pop up the
        dialing menu and use the cursor keys to select "Edit":

                A -  Name                : Xeno
                B -  Number              : 022039697303
                C -  Dial string #       : 1
                D -  Local echo          : No
                E -  Script              : /etc/ppp/login.script
                F -  Username            : ppp-382
                G -  Password            : top-secret
                H -  Terminal Emulation  : VT102
                I -  Backspace key sends : Delete
                J -  Linewrap            : Off
                K -  Line Settings       : Curr 8N1

        This is a sample entry to dial to one of my ISPs. The script
        "/etc/ppp/login.script" is shown below. Two special variables
        are passed to this script: $(LOGIN) and $(PASS) which are
        set to the values submitted as username (F) and password (G).
        This feature makes minicom somewhat flexible because you
        need only one script to automate your login to several ISPs.


  2.5. A login script

        "minicom" starts the login-script after it recieves the string
        "CONNECT". To be precise, "minicom" does not execute the script
        itself but calls the utility "runscript" as a sub-process for that.

        Below is a example I use for my ISPs.

                # v1.0, 20.08.96 Winfried Trümper <winni@xpilot.org>
                print ""
                print "Automatic login via /etc/ppp/login.script"
        
                ## uncomment if you need to press enter to get the prompt
                #send ""
        
                expect {
                        "ogin:"
                        "ogin>"
                        "sername:"
                        "sername>"
                        "NO CARRIER" exit 1
                }
                send "$(LOGIN)"
                expect {
                        "assword:"
                        "assword>"
                        timeout 20
                }
                send "$(PASS)"
                expect {
                        "port"  send "ppp"
                        "Start your PPP now"
                        "}!}!}"
                        timeout 10
                }
                print ""
                print "Now switching into ppp-mode ..."
                print ""

                ! /usr/sbin/pppd  file /etc/ppp/mini_options

                print ""
                print "the command   killall -TERM pppd   terminates pppd"


        The ability of "runscript" to call external programs is used
        to start "pppd". Copy your original options-file for ppp
        to "/etc/ppp/options.ttyS1"  (where you have to replace "ttyS1"
        with the device your modem is attached to) and delete  all
        lines from /etc/ppp/options that are specific to your modem
        (like "connect", "crtscts" or "modem").
        Put the options that should be specific to the ppp-connection
        via minicom in "/etc/ppp/mini_options". One of these options
        should be

                disconnect "chat '' '\d\d+++\d\dATH\r\c'"

        This is a must because "pppd" is fed via stdin and can't hang
        up the modem via "crtscts".


  2.6. Automated dialing on startup

        Use the option "-d" to dial a certain telephone number on
        startup of minicom.
        You may also try

                open -sl -- minicom -d 1

        To throw minicom at another console (see the Consoles-Many
        mini-HOWTO for details).


  2.7. Future extensions

        Because "pppd" is a daemon it is not designed for
        user-interaction or observation. Thats ok. After all, we're
        using a unix-like os ...

        The canonical solution is a backend. Any volunteers to hack
        up minicom?
        Fancy extensions would be:

              - automatic generation of the login-script by watching
                the user dialing in manually

              - automatic evalutaion of the log-files with
                correction of options

              - extraction of messages like shown in 2.3.
