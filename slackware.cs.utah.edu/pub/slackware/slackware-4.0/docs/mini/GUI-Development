Gui Developement Tools for Linux
================================

Introduction (English)
----------------------
In  the  first  days, Linux was said to be a hacker envirement  in
both  sense. With the further developement its reputation changed.
Today Linux gets known as a developement plattform including the X
window  system and the several GNU utilities. Following  the  fact
that GNU C and C++ are pseudo standard serveral developement tools
has been built to support a quicker and easier X programming.
This  GUI-Developement-HOWTO should help the programmer,  beginner
or   experienced,  to  choose  the  tool,  which  fits  most   his
requirements.
I  take  no  responsibility for mistakes in prices or  copyrights.
Please read the including copyright license!
If  you know further Gui Developement Tools please send me a short

Einfuehrung (Deutsch)
---------------------
In den ersten Tagen, hatte Linux den Ruf einer Hackerumgebung. Mit
den  Monaten  der Entwicklung aenderte sich dieser  schlechte  Ruf.
Heute   wird   Linux  mit  dem  X  Window  System   zusammen   als
Entwicklungsystem   gepriesen,  auf  dem  viele  Entwicklungstools
erhaeltlich sind. Neben den zahlreichen GNU Utilities, die sich  in
den  letzten  Jahren, vor allem in der From  des  GNU  C  und  C++
Compilers,   zu  einer  Art  pseudo  Standard  entwickelt   haben,
entstanden mehr oder weniger bekannte Entwicklungsoberflaechen.
Das  GUI-Developement-HOWTO  soll dem  angehenden,  wie  auch  dem
erfahrenen   Programmierer   die  Auswahl   fuer   eine   geeignete
Entwicklungsoberflaeche erleichtern.

Software Portability with imake

By Paul DuBois
1st Edition July 1993
390 pages, ISBN: 1-56592-055-4

imake  is  a  utility that works with make to enable  code  to  be
compiled  and  installed on different UNIX machines.  imake  makes
possible the wide portability of the X Window System code  and  is
widely considered an X tool, but it's also useful for any software
project that needs to be ported to many UNIX systems.

This  Nutshell Handbook(R)--the only book available  on  imake  is
ideal  for  X and UNIX programmers who want their software  to  be
portable. The book is divided into two sections. The first section
is  a general explanation of imake, X configuration files, and how
to  write and debug an Imakefile. The second section describes how
to  write  configuration files, and presents a configuration  file
architecture  that  allows  development  of  coexisting  sets   of
configuration  files. Several sample sets of  configuration  files
are described and are available free over the Net.

424 pages, ISBN: 1-56592-017-1

Indispensable  companion  to  the X  Window  System  Series.  Once
programmers have mastered the concepts behind X and learned how to
program  in  Xlib  and  Xt there is still a  mass  of  details  to
remember.  The  X  Window  System in a Nutshell  fills  this  gap.
Experienced  X  programmers  can use  this  single-volume  desktop
companion  for  most common questions, keeping the full  X  Window
System  series of manuals for detailed reference. X in a  Nutshell
contains  essential  information in a boiled-down  quick-reference
format that makes it easy to find the answers needed most often.

This book has been updated to cover R5 but is still useful for R4.
The   descriptions  of  the  functions  have  been  expanded   and
clarified,  with  improved cross-referencing to important  related
functions.  Includes material on Xcms and the internationalization
features of R5.

As  X  moves out of the hacker's domain and into the "real world,"
users  can't be expected to master all the ins and outs of setting
up  and administering their own X software. That will increasingly
become  the  domain of system administrators. Even for experienced
system administrators X raises many issues, both because of subtle
changes  in  the standard UNIX way of doing things and  because  X
blurs  the boundaries between different platforms. Under X,  users
can run applications across the network, on systems with different
resources  (including  fonts, colors, and screen  size.)  Many  of
these issues are poorly understood, and the technology for dealing
with them is in rapid flux.

This  book  is  the first and only book devoted to the  issues  of
system administration for X and X-based networks, written not just
for  UNIX system administrators but for anyone faced with the  job
of  administering  X  (including those running  X  on  stand-alone
workstations).  The  X  Window  System  Administrator's  Guide  is
available either alone or packaged with the XCD. The CD provides X
source code and binaries to complement the book's instructions for
installing  the  software. It contains over 600 megabytes  of  X11
source  code and binaries stored in ISO9660 and RockRidge formats.
This will allow several types of UNIX workstations to mount the CD-
ROM  as  a filesystem, browse through the source code and  install
pre-built software.

Motif Tools: Streamlined GUI Design and Programming with the Xmt
Library
By David Flanagan
1024 pages, ISBN: 1-56592-044-9,

New from O'Reilly,  Motif  Tools  and the Xmt programming  library
           that
accompanies it on CD-ROM offer resources to help Motif programmers
dramatically  speed  up application development with the X Toolkit
           and
Motif.

Here's what author David Flanagan has to say about why he was
inspired to write the book and the Xmt library:
"The  need for a convenience toolkit is something that not  enough
programmers and managers realize--Motif is too often viewed  as  a
complete  GUI  development package, when in fact it  was  designed
only  to  provide a standard base level of functionality. This  is
where  the  Xmt library comes in; it provides many of the  widgets
and  functions  that  are  implemented  over  and  over  again  by
developers.  My  aim  was  to  put  programmer  ease-of-use  first
(something the designers of Motif obviously did not do) and create
a library that really simplifies GUI development."

The  Xmt  library  contains  eight custom  widgets  and  over  260
convenien  ceroutines  that  handle many  tricky  aspects  of  GUI
programming. The Layout widget, for example, is a flexible manager
widget  that makes the confusing and awkward Motif Form  widget  a
thing  of the past. And a single Menu widget will create an entire
pulldown menu system for an application by reading a special  menu
description from a resource file or from C code. Other features of
the  library  simplify  the use of Motif XmStrings,  automate  the
transfer  of  data  between the fields of  an  application's  data
structures  and  the  widgets of its dialog  boxes,  and  make  it
possible  to  automatically create a widget  hierarchy  completely
described in a resource file.

Motif  Tools  is a comprehensive programmer's guide and  reference
manual  for  the  Xmt library.  It guides the reader  through  the
development  of  a  complete application: from  first  conception,
through  design  and  implementation,  and  on  to  the  finishing
stylistic  touches--the  myriad  little  details  that  make   the
difference  between an application that looks sharp and  one  that
just looks ordinary, between one that is a pleasure to use and one
that  is  just usable. Scattered throughout the book and collected
on  the  CD  are programming tips and tidbits submitted  by  Motif
programmers  from  around the world. The book includes  a  single-
programmer  license to use the Xmt library source code. Additional
licenses may be purchased at a nominal cost.
