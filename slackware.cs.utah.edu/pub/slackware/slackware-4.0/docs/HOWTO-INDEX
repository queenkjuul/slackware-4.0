  1.  What Are Linux HOWTOs?

  Linux HOWTOs are documents which describe in detail a certain aspect
  of configuring or using Linux. For example, there is the Installation
  HOWTO, which gives instructions on installing Linux, and the Mail
  HOWTO, which describes how to set up and configure mail under Linux.
  Other examples include the NET-3 HOWTO and the Printing HOWTO.

  HOWTOs are comprehensive docs - much like an FAQ but generally not in
  question-and-answer format. However, many HOWTOs contain an FAQ
  section at the end.

  There are several HOWTO formats available: plain text, PostScript,
  DVI, and HTML.

  In addition to the HOWTOs, there are a multitude of mini-HOWTOs on
  short, specific subjects.  They are only available in plain text and
  HTML format.


  2.  Where Can I Get Linux HOWTOs?

  HOWTOs can be retrieved via anonymous FTP from the following sites:

  ·  ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO

  ·  ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/docs/HOWTO


  as well as many mirror sites.

  You can also browse HOWTOs in HTML format
  <http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/>.  Many mirror sites
  <http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/hmirrors.html> mirror the HTML files.
  metalab.unc.edu is heavily used, so please use a mirror site if
  possible.

  HOWTOs are also posted towards the beginning of the month to the
  Usenet newsgroup comp.os.linux.answers.  There is a tool called
  NewstoHOWTO <ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/news/misc/> that
  will assemble the postings.

  3.3.  Special HOWTOs

  The High Availability HOWTO, by Harald Milz <hm@seneca.muc.de> is
  available at http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/ALPHA/linux-ha/High-
  Availability-HOWTO.html.  It is not included with the HOWTO collection
  because it relies on figures and cannot be distributed in all
  supported formats.


  The Graphics mini-HOWTO, by Michael J. Hammel <mjhammel@graphics-
  muse.org> is available at http://www.graphics-muse.org/linux/lgh.html.
  It is not included with the HOWTO collection because it needs to use a
  lot of images, which don't translate to other output formats.


  3.4.  Unmaintained HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs

  There are a number of unmaintained documents at
  ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/unmaintained.  These are
  kept around since old documentation is sometimes better than none.
  However, you should be aware that you are reading old documentation.





  4.  Writing and Submitting a HOWTO

  If you are interested in writing a HOWTO or mini-HOWTO, please get in
  touch with me FIRST!!! at linux-howto@metalab.unc.edu.


  Here are a few guidelines that you should follow when writing a HOWTO
  or mini-HOWTO:


  ·  Try to use meaningful structure and organization, and write
     clearly. Remember that many of the people reading HOWTOs do not
     speak English as their first language.

  ·  If you are writing a HOWTO, you must use the SGML-Tools package,
     available from http://www.sgmltools.org/, to format the HOWTO. This
     package allows us to produce LaTeX (for DVI and PostScript), plain
     text, and HTML from a single source document, and was designed
     specifically for the HOWTOs. This also gives all of the HOWTOs a
     uniform look.  It is very important that you format and review the
     output of the formatting in PostScript, plain text and HTML.

  ·  If you are writing a mini-HOWTO, you can either use SGML (as
     described above) or HTML.  If you use SGML for your mini-HOWTO, it
     will be pubished along with the HOWTOs in LDP books.

  ·  Make sure that all of the information is correct. I can't stress
     this enough. When in doubt, speculate, but make it clear that
     you're only guessing.

  ·  Make sure that you are covering the most recent version of the
     available software. Also, be sure to include full instructions on
     where software can be downloaded from (FTP site name, full
     pathname), and the current version number and release date of the
     software.

  ·  Include an FAQ section at the end, if appropriate. Many HOWTO
     documents need an ``FAQ'' or ``Common Problems'' section to cover
     information which can't be covered in the regular text.

  ·  Use other HOWTOs or mini-HOWTOs as a model!  The SGML source to the
     HOWTOs is available on Linux FTP sites.  In addition, have a look
     at the LDP Style Guide <http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/LDP-Style-
     Guide.html> for some guidelines.

  ·  Make sure that your name, email address, date, and a version number
     is near the beginning of the document.  You could also include WWW
     addresses and a snail mail address if you want.  The standard
     header is:

             Title
             Author's name and email address
             Version number and date



  for example:

          The Linux HOWTO Index
          by Tim Bynum
          v2.10.29, 31 July 1997





  ·  Lastly, be prepared to receive questions and comments about your
     writing.  There are several hundreds of accesses to the HOWTO
     collection every day from around the world!

  After you have written the HOWTO, mail it to me.  If you used SGML-
  Tools, simply mail me the SGML source; I take care of formatting the
  documents.  I'll also take care of archiving the HOWTOs on
  metalab.unc.edu and posting them to the various newsgroups.

  It is important that you go through me when submitting a HOWTO, as I
  maintain the archives and need to keep track of what HOWTOs are being
  written and who is doing what.

  Then, all you have to do is send me periodic updates whenever
  appropriate.
