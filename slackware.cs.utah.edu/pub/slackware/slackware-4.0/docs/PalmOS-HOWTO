  1.  Introduction

  First there was the Pilot, then the PalmPilot, and now we have the
  Palm III from Palm Computing Devices.  IBM sells a rebadged version of
  the PalmPilot Professional, which they call the WorkPad.  What are
  these gadgets?  They are Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), sometimes
  known as palm-top computers.  Sold as an electronic combination of
  address book, telephone directory and memo pad, they are actually
  general-purpose computers capable of running almost any kind of
  application.  The trick is to find Palm OS applications to fit your
  needs and to be able to share your data with your Linux system.  Palm
  OS devices incorporate software to synchronize their data with
  programs running on another computer.  Such software for use on a
  Windows 95 system is generally bundled with the device.  A MacOS
  version is also available.  If the foriegn computer is running some
  other operating system, you need to find third party software to work
  with your Palm OS device.  This document describes such software that
  is available for use on a Linux or unix system.

  The pilot-unix mailing list is maintained by Matthew Cravit pilot-
  unix-owner@lists.best.com.  Its mandate is:


       The pilot-unix mailing list is for discussion and idea-sharing for those
       interested in using the US Robotics Pilot PDAs with UNIX systems. This
       includes people who are interested in helping to develop tools to allow the
       Pilot to operate with UNIX, and possibly to develop an SDK for the Pilot
       for Unix.

  2.  General Information

  2.1.  Hardware Installation

  Palm OS devices come with a ``cradle'' for exchanging data with the
  desktop computer.  This device is actually a serial cable with a
  custom holder for the Palm OS devices and an integrated `HotSync'
  button.  Plug your cradle into a spare serial port on your computer.
  When you run each of the stand-alone programs, you will need to place
  your Palm OS device in the cradle and push the `HotSync' button so the
  Palm OS device knows that it has to communicate.  If the Palm OS
  device happens to be off when the button is pushed, it will turn
  itself on.

  For convenience, create a device, /dev/pilot which will be an
  alternate name for the serial port to which your Palm OS device cradle
  is connected.  As the root user, enter the following at the shell
  prompt:


       ln /dev/cua0 /dev/pilot




  Replace cua0 with the name of the port to which you connected your
  Palm OS device's cradle.





  3.  Sharing Palm OS device Data with your Linux System

  3.1.  The pilot-link software

  The pilot-link suite of software tools allows you to download programs
  onto your Palm OS device, and transfer data for the Palm OS device's
  various built-in programs between the Linux system and the Palm OS
  device.  While these programs are not quite as seamless as the desktop
  software that comes with the Palm OS device, they do allow you to copy
  your data in both directions.  In general, each separate program in
  the pilot-link suite manages one type of data.



  3.1.1.  Installing the pilot-link software

  The prepackaged versions will inevitably lag slightly behind the
  master distribution, but will be easier to install and not require
  configuration.  The master distribution might be a better choice in
  those rare occasions when you have been waiting for a particular
  feature or bug fix.

  You can get the Debian Linux (i386) port of pilot-link version 0.8.7
  from ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-
  i386/otherosfs/pilot-link_0.8.7-2.deb.
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-
  i386/otherosfs/pilot-link_0.8.7-2.deb.  If this file does not exist,
  you will likely find a newer version located in the same directory.
  If all else fails, or if you want a more recent version than has been
  packaged for Debian, you can install the generic distribution, as
  detailed below.  Install this file in the normal manner and skip to
  Using the pilot-link software.


  You can get the RedHat Linux (i386) port of pilot-link version 0.8.9
  from ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/i386/pilot-
  link-0.8.9-1.i386.rpm.  If this file does not exist, you will likely
  find a newer version located in the same directory.  If all else
  fails, or if you want a more recent version than has been packaged for
  RedHat, you can install the generic distribution, as detailed below.
  Install this file in the normal manner and skip to Using the pilot-
  link software.

  For other versions of Linux or unix, or if you need the absolute
  latest version, download the version 0.9.0 of pilot-link from
  ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/pilot-link.0.9.0.tar.gz.  The
  version number is likely to change, but new versions should end up in
  the same location with a similar name.

  Once you have the software distribution, unpack it with:


       tar -xvzf pilot-link.0.9.0.tar.gz




  If your version of tar does not support the -z option, decompress the
  archive with gunzip, as follows:


       gunzip pilot-link.0.9.0.tar.gz | tar -xvf -




  This will create a directory (pilot-link.0.9.0) containing the source.

  Change your working directory to the source (pilot-link.0.9.0)
  directory.

  Run ./configure.  This will search through your system for information
  needed to compile the software.  configure will set things up to be
  installed in /usr/local by default.  If you want to change it, run
  ./configure --prefix=DIR, where DIR is replaced with the name of the
  directory to which the software will be installed.

  Run make.  This will compile the software.  The software will not be
  installed until later, so that you have a chance to try it out first.
  (If you are replacing an older version with a newer release, you may
  wish to check and make sure that no functionality that you need has
  been broken.  Generally, this is not a problem.)

  As the root user, run make install.  This will copy the software into
  directories under /usr/local (or wherever you specified with the
  --prefix option).  If you can not log in as root, you can install the
  software to some directory where you have write access.

  Don't forget to add any new directories of executables to your search
  path.


  3.1.2.  Using the pilot-link software

  Most of the programs in the pilot-link suite are conduits, that is
  they transfer data into or out of your Palm OS device.

  Each time you use of one of these programs, press the HotSync button
  on your Palm OS device's cradle.  This will initiate the Palm OS
  device side of the data transfer.  Note that not all of these programs
  prompt you to press the `HotSync' button, so you may have to remember
  to do it yourself.


  For more details, and other options to these programs, view the
  corresponding manual page.  There is an overview manual page under the
  name pilot-link.  For the pilot-xfer program, for example, type man
  pilot-xfer at your unix shell prompt.




  3.1.2.1.  pilot-xfer

  Possibly the most useful program in the pilot-link suite, pilot-xfer
  allows you to install programs on your Palm OS device, make a backup,
  and restore that backup.


  To install a program:


       pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -i program.prc




  To backup your Palm OS device:


       pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -b backup-directory




  This will copy all of the databases on your Palm OS device, (including
  programs?)  to a directory called ``backup-directory'', creating it if
  it does not already exist.

  To restore data to Palm OS device:


       pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -r backup-directory




  Generally, you will only need to do this if your Palm OS device loses
  power or if you have to do a hard reset.

  To list the programs on your Palm OS device:


       pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -l







  3.1.2.2.  install-memo

  Install a Linux file onto the Palm OS device as a memo.


  To install a memo into your (already existing) project category:


       install-memo /dev/pilot -c project project.memo




  The name of the file will be inserted into the memo as its first line
  and will appear in the directory of memos on your Palm OS device.



  3.1.2.3.  memos

  This program grabs each memo from the Palm OS device and prints it out
  in standard mailbox format.

  To view your memos:


       memos /dev/pilot











  3.1.2.4.  pilot-addresses

  pilot-addresses Transfer the address database to or from the Palm OS
  device.

  To write your address data to a Linux file from your Palm OS device:


       pilot-addresses /dev/pilot -w storage.file




  To read your address data from a Linux file onto your Palm OS device:


       pilot-addresses /dev/pilot -r storage.file










  3.2.  MakeDoc

  One short-coming of the Palm OS device's built-in memo program is that
  it does not deal well with large documents.  To compensate for this,
  Rick Bram <mailto:rbram@concentric.net> wrote Doc, a document reader
  for the Palm OS device.  (See
  http://www.concentric.net/~rbram/doc.shtml).  Documents can be
  converted to the Doc format with MakeDoc, by Pat Beirne
  <mailto:pat.beirne@sympatico.ca>.



  3.2.1.  Installing MakeDoc

  MakeDoc can be downloaded from
  http://www.concentric.net/~rbram/makedoc7.cpp.  Compile it with your
  C++ compiler and install the resulting executable as ``makedoc'' in a
  directory in your search path.  There seems to be a small bug in
  makedoc (version 0.7a) in that it does not output a newline as the
  last character displayed to the user.  This does not seem to affect
  the resulting document file, but it is annoying.

  There is a new version out, but it requires Java.  Take a look at Pat
  Beirne's MakeDoc web page at
  http://cpu563.adsl.sympatico.ca/MakeDocJ.htm.



  3.2.2.  Using MakeDoc

  Use MakeDoc as follows:


       makedoc data.txt data.prc "Data to display with Doc"




  This will create a file data.prc, which can be installed on your Palm
  OS device with pilot-xfer.  The text "Data to display with Doc" will
  be displayed in the directory of documents that Doc manages.

  The syntax for MakeDoc is as follows:


       makedoc [-n] [-b] <text-file> <prc-file> <story-name>
       or
       makedoc -d [-b] <prc-file> <text-file>





     <text-file>
        The file that you wish to convert.

     <prc-file>
        The name of the resulting file.  (End the name with ``.prc''.)

     <story-name>
        The name you want displayed in the Doc or Jdoc directory of
        documents.

  There are also options to decode the resulting .prc file and manage
  various compression options.

  E.  A History of Palm OS devices.

  There are two versions of the Pilot.  They are the 1000 and the 5000
  and have 128k and 512k of RAM, respectively. They come with Palm OS
  1.0 in ROM.

  Then came two devices with the name PalmPilot.  They are the PalmPilot
  Personal and the PalmPilot Professional and have 512k and 1 Meg of
  RAM, respectively.  They also have a backlighting feature for the LCD
  panel and version 2.0 of the operating system.  The Professional also
  comes with a TCP/IP stack and a few extra programs built-in.

  (IBM has released a rebadged version of the PalmPilot Professional,
  which they call a WorkPad.)

  Now we have the Palm III, which has a redesigned case and an infrared
  port, not to mention the 2 Meg of RAM and Palm OS 3.0.

  It is possible to upgrade any Pilot by swapping out the memory card,
  which includes both RAM & ROM.  Of course, this doesn't get you
  backlighting for the original Pilot series.
