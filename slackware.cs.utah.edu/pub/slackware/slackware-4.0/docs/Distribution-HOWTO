  The Linux Distribution HOWTO
  Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>
  v6.2, 10 September 1998

  This document is intended to help new users choose a Linux distribu­
  tion, and to help experienced users track the state of the Linux mar­
  ket.  It does not aim to be a complete list of Linux distributions for
  all platforms, but instead focuses on leading English-language Intel
  distributions available on CD-ROM and accessible to Linux novices.

  1.  Introduction

  There is no single distribution of the Linux software. Instead, there
  are many such distributions, available both via anonymous FTP and by
  mail order on CD-ROM.

  The purpose of this document is to provide short summaries of the
  English-language Linux distributions, and to provide pointers for the
  reader to find more information.  A German Distributions HOWTO was
  formerly maintained by Marco Budde but seems to have disappeared.  We
  are not aware of any distributions in languages other than English and
  German.

  The information presented here is not complete; there are other Linux
  distributions than are listed here. If you are associated with a
  distribution we don't list, please see ``Submissions To This
  Document'' near the end of this document for information on making a
  submission.  It's easy and should take less then five minutes.

  For a more complete list of distributions (albeit with sparser
  information on each) see the Linux HQ Distributions List
  <http://www.linuxhq.com/dist-index.html>.

  Disclaimer: We make absolutely no guarantee as to the correctness of
  the information, prices, and ordering details given in this document.
  Check the last-modified field of each to get an idea of its currency,
  then go to the vendor's web page for up-to-date information.
  Furthermore, unless otherwise stated the Linux software comes with
  ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

  Your editor tries to stick to facts in most of this HOWTO, but he has
  some opinions on the state of the Linux market.  If you care what they
  are, you can read them under ``Editorial Recommendations''.

  Disclosure: I (esr) have no financial connection to any Linux vendor,
  nor have I accepted any renumeration or perquisites from any vendor
  other than free product for review (and one T-shirt from Red Hat).


  1.1.  New versions of this document

  This document will be posted monthly to the newsgroups
  comp.os.linux.answers . The document is archived on a number of Linux
  FTP sites, including sunsite.unc.edu in pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.

  You can also view the latest version of this HOWTO on the World Wide
  Web via the URL  <http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Distribution-
  HOWTO.html>.

  Feel free to mail any questions or comments about this HOWTO to Eric
  S. Raymond, esr@snark.thyrsus.com.  Please do not send me general
  Linux questions or requests for help in choosing a distribution unless
  you're willing to hire me at normal consulting rates; I don't have
  time to deal with them, and I try to put everything I know about
  choosing a distribution in this document.


  1.2.  Recent Changes

  Yggdrasil Plug-And-Play and Craftworks Linux seem no longer to be
  available for sale, and have been dropped.  DOSLINUX has also been
  dropped due to its specialist nature.


  1.3.  Overview of the Linux Market

  In the beginning (say, 1993), a Linux distribution was something you
  downloaded off the Internet onto floppies.  Installation was a
  laborious process and repeated frustrations due to bad media were
  common.

  Then came cheap CD-ROM drives and the CD-ROM, a medium ideally suited
  for shipping large volumes of operating-system software cheaply.
  There's a whole mini-industry now built around commercial CD-ROM
  Linuxes, and (because the vendors have actual cash flow to fund
  support and marketing) they increasingly dominate the Linux world.
  Debian is now the only significant non-commercial release, and even it
  seems to be propagated largely by shovelware CD-ROMs.

  Most of the CD-ROM distributions (including Slackware, Yggdrasil and
  Red Hat) are still available for FTP from the home sites of their
  developers.  But if you have a CD-ROM drive and a few dollars, you
  will have many more distributions and more support options to choose
  from (and you'll usually get some useful paper documentation).  For
  more on the details of installation, see the Linux Installation HOWTO,
  <http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO.html>.

  Prices for CD-ROM distributions of Intel Linuxes start at $20 and top
  out at a whole $50 (and the extra few dollars can buy real value).
  Many vendors sell subscription deals that will lower your cost-per-CD
  for regular updates over the subscription period.

  Price correlates with features and quality pretty well (as one would
  expect in a very competitive market).  Your editor recommends paying
  the few extra dollars for a top-drawer original CD-ROM distribution;
  this will pay off in fewer installation and administration hassles
  down the road.

  Making good choices is much simpler than it used to be.  In 1995-96
  the Linux market underwent a serious shakeout, with a very few
  commercial distributions emerging as leaders while weaker ones
  disappeared or stagnated.  The toll among general-purpose non-
  commercial distributions has been even fiercer; essentially, only
  Debian survives in this role.

  As a result, the three-tier structure of primary distribution
  builders, value-added repackagers, and bottom-feeding CD shovellers
  that used to define the market has nearly collapsed.  To be
  competitive in 1997, a Linux outfit (whether commercial or
  noncommercial) has to offer reasonable support and behave like a
  primary distribution builder, whether it's really one or not. So as
  long as you look for a recent freeze date, it is pretty hard to get
  stuck with a dud distribution these days.


  1.4.  Editorial Recommendations

  Last section, the facts.  In this section, my opinions (for whatever
  they're worth -- and remember the caveat about free advice).  There is
  no substitute for doing your own evaluation based on experience and
  the data in this guide, and these are intended more to illuminate my
  possible biases than as a guide to what you should do.

  From the beginnings of the Linux CD-ROM industry in 1993 to Fall 1995,
  Yggdrasil was the king of the hill -- it essentially founded the CD-
  ROM market and then set the standard for everybody else.  I used
  Yggdrasil, and I recommended it over commercial System V versions for
  its superior documentation, large collection of applications, and
  enlightened policy of sending free releases to freeware authors and
  dedicating part of the price of each CD-ROM to financially supporting
  free software.  But Yggdrasil hasn't issued a new release since 1995
  and they've been left behind by the market.

  I now run Red Hat Linux and am quite satisfied with it.  Red Hat's RPM
  technology currently gives it, IMO, a technical edge over any other
  vendor.  They've made most of the right moves at the right times and I
  consider them the current market leader.

  If you're ideologically wedded to using a non-commercial distribution,
  Debian seems to me to be the clear choice, the only one left with a
  serious support team behind it.

  These opinions should certainly not be interpreted as an unconditional
  endorsement; different Linux distributions are optimized for different
  needs, and yours may well be best served by some other distribution
  (especially if, unlike me, you're mainly a DOS user and are looking
  for a distribution tuned for dual-boot systems and being launched from
  DOS).

  Furthermore, industry standing is volatile.  By the time you read
  this, Red Hat or Debian may well have fallen off their games and been
  displaced by hungrier newcomers.

  2.  American Linux Distributions

  All these distributions are available on CD-ROM (some of the non-
  commercial ones only show up on network-archive snapshots).  Most of
  these are available for free over the network (but the commercial ones
  won't support you if you buy this way).  They are custom-assembled,
  rather than just being re-packagings of a pre-existing network
  release.

  They are listed in alphabetical order.


  2.1.  Caldera OpenLinux


     Distributor:
        Caldera, Inc.
        633 South 550 East
        Provo, Utah 84606

        Net: info@caldera.com
        WWW:  <http://www.caldera.com>
        FTP:  <ftp://ftp.caldera.com>
        Vox: (801)-377-7678
        Fax: (801)-377-8752


     Provider's Description:
        Caldera is shipping OpenLinux 1.2 in a three-tiered family of
        products: OpenLinux Lite, OpenLinux Base, and OpenLinux
        Standard.

        OpenLinux Lite is a freely available evaluation of the OpenLinux
        product (it includes a 90-day evalutation of the Caldera
        integrated Desttop--the full licensed version of the desktop is
        included in the Base and Standard products). OpenLinxu Lite can
        be downloaded from Caldera's ftp site, or obtainded on CD for
        the cost of shipping. It is also designed for use by book and
        software publishers to provide a commercially stable Linux
        offering with their books and software products.

        OpenLinux Base contains everything that is in Lite plus it is a
        complete, easy-to-install Linux operating system, with
        integrated Desktop, Internet client and server components, and
        Intranet connectivity. OpenLinux Base includes Netscape
        Navigator and full documentation.

        OpenLinux Standard includes what is in Base plus more high-end,
        name brand, commercial software components (such as Netscape
        FastTrack Web Server, Netscape Navigator Gold Web browser and
        authoring tools, ADABAS D database, StarOffice productivity
        suite, Caldera OpenDOS, and NetWare client and administration
        tools).

        All three tiers of the OpenLinux 1.2 release are currently
        available.

        With Caldera OpenLinux, you can see a whole world of powerful
        new computing, even the power of a UNIX workstation on your PC!
        By using a Linux kernel, OpenLinux gives you speed and stability
        that compare to systems costing thousands of dollars. Open Linux
        also gives you:

     ·  Real multi-tasking runs many text or graphical applications at
        once; no application can cause another to crash, unlike less
        robust systems.
     ·  The Linux 2.0 kernel gives super-fast TCP/IP access to the
        Internet, plus loadable device drivers, for the most efficient
        use of your system resources.

     ·  Easy-to-follow, quick installation with menu-based choices and
        auto-detection of your hardware make installation a snap on most
        systems. The Getting Started Guide (included) provides a step-
        by-step illustrated procedure, with troubleshooting tips.

        No other Linux system includes a complete, integrated desktop
        interface with configuration tools and graphical editor. Its
        powerful drag-and-drop capabilities come pre-configured with
        thousands of icons and application settings. The Desktop
        provides a convenient place where you can store your favorite
        programs and data files for instant access. The Desktop gives
        you:


     ·  Drag-and-drop launching of programs with data files.

     ·  An integrated graphical text editor.

     ·  Easy access to an array of powerful system configuration tools.

     ·  A configurable icon bar, custom layouts, and preference
        settings.

     ·  Powerful file management using drag-and-drop or graphical
        dialogs.


     Ordering:

  2.2.  Debian Linux Distribution


     Distributor:
        Software in the Public Interest, Inc.  PO Box 1326
        Boston, Ma. 02117 USA

        Net: info@debian.org
        WWW:  <http://www.debian.org>
        FTP:  <ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian>


     Provider's Description:
        Debian Linux is the result of a volunteer effort to create a
        high-quality non-commercial Linux distribution.  Debian Linux
        2.0 is a complete and fully-functional Unix-compatible operating
        system for the personal computer.  The system uses ELF
        executables and libc6 (unlikeprevious Debian versions, which
        used libc5).  At present, Debian Linux is available for the IBM
        PC architecture (386/486/Pentium) and m68k, with versions for
        Sparc and Alpha promised for 2.1.  ARM, PPC, and UltraSparc
        ports are underway.

        Debian Linux is an easy-to-upgrade distribution that mostly
        consists of freely redistributable software from a number of
        different sources and systems.  Support for shadow passwords is
        available, although it should be considered experimental in the
        1.1 release.  Non-free packages may also obtained, making Debian
        a well-rounded system.

        The benefits of Debian Linux are its upgradability, well-defined
        dependencies between packages, and its open development.  It is
        the only distribution of Linux that is being developed co-
        operatively by many individuals through the Internet, in the
        same spirit as Linux and other open-source operating systems.
        More than 400 package maintainers are working on over 1500
        packages and improving Debian Linux.  A sophisticated bug
        tracking system allows users to easily report bugs and security
        concerns which are quickly dealt with by the Debian community.
        A new release of the package will soon occur on well-known ftp
        archives.

        Debian Linux is a very dynamic distribution.  Snap-shot releases
        are made about every three months, the ftp archives are updated
        daily.

        For more information about Debian Linux, please refer to the
        files at  <ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/> or visit our World
        Wide Web page at  <http://www.debian.org/>.

        If you're interested in joining this project you are invited to
        subscribe to either debian-user@lists.debian.org or debian-
        devel@lists.debian.org by sending a mail to debian-user-
        request@lists.debian.org (or debian-devel-request respectively)
        with the word "help" in the subject line.


     Internet Access:
        Debian Linux is available via anonymous FTP from
        <ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/> and on a mirror near to you.

  2.3.  Linux Pro


     Distributor:
        WorkGroup Solutions, Inc.
        P.O. Box 460190
        Aurora, CO 80046-0190

        FTP:  <ftp://ftp.wgs.com/pub2/wgs>


     Provider's Description:
        The charter of the WGS Linux Pro CD is different from all other
        distributions currently on the market.  We are actively pursuing
        penetration into the commercial marketplace for Linux.
        Everything we do is aimed at increasing the size of the Linux
        community, and helping Linux to become THE one true operating
        system, not just an operating system.

        WGS Linux Pro consists of our Main "Stable" Linux CD, for which
        we select what we consider to be the best Linux distribution
        available.  Then we make bug fixes & minor enhancements.  This
        CD often contains software older than the latest, under the
        theory that "the latest is not always the greatest".  Together
        with this approach we provide technical support as well as
        support agreements.  For this reason WGS Linux Pro is considered
        a primary Linux distribution.  Optionally, and in addition to
        our primary CD, we supply supplemental CDs containing all the
        latest Linux software (including current archives of the tsx-11,
        sunsite, and Red Hat sites).  Virtually anything you will get
        with anyone's Linux product can be found on these supplemental
        CDs.  We continually add more to these supplemental CDs as
        software becomes available.  Even with all this, pricing on our
        product line is very favorable when correctly compared to other
        Linux distributions.  Also optional (included with Linux Pro+)
        is a professionally produced and printed manual containing the
        Linux documentation project and more!

        Current version is 4.0a; kernel is 1.2.13 with installable 2.0.x
        on the CD.


     Internet Access:
        Look in  <http://www.wgs.com> for a list of WGS products, and
        latest information on the CD-ROM.


     Ordering:
        WGS Linux Pro is available on CD from dealers and distributors
        worldwide, and soon from our FTP site.

        You may call, fax, email, or mail us, to purchase, or request
        additional information.  We will be happy to respond to any
        question you have.  We accept American Express, Visa, Discover,
        and MasterCard, or purchase orders with approval of credit.


     Miscellaneous:
        Complete information is available on our FTP site.

        WGS publishes a free E-Mail newsletter on Linux and FlagShip to
        which you may subscribe by just emailing us your request.

        In addition we carry Motif, FlagShip, A line of books, and other
        products to make your experience with Linux more complete and
        fulfilling.  Check us out!

        WWW:  <http://www.redhat.com>
        FTP:  <ftp://ftp.redhat.com>


     Provider's Description:
        Red Hat 5.1 is based on the 2.0.34 kernel and is available for
        Intel, Sparc and Alpha platforms.

        Four installation innovations make Red Hat the easiest Linux to
        install ever.  Our graphical installation mode brings you
        straight up into X for most of the installation.  Our boot disk
        creation script eases selection of the proper boot disk, and it
        saves your existing network configuration information and
        XF86Config so you don't have to configure TCP/IP or X!  Our FTP
        install allows you to install simply by downloading 3 floppy
        disk images -- the rest is done automatically!  And finally, the
        installation includes seamless support for PCMCIA devices --
        install Red Hat on your laptop as easily as on your desktop
        machine!

        After installing Red Hat Linux once, you will never need to
        reinstall Linux again!  The new RPM packaging system is
        sophisticated enough to allow upgrading to new Red Hat releases
        without reinstalling your system - no partitioning, no backing
        up all your files, no headaches.


     Ordering:
        Available directly from Red Hat Software and most distributors
        of Linux related products.  Please contact Red Hat Software for
        ordering details (on-line ordering is available through Red
        Hat's Web).  Suggested retail price is for the Intel version is
        $49.95, for the Sparc and Alpha versions $99.95.

     Editor's Comments:
        The big selling point of this distribution is RPM, the Red Hat
        Package Manager.  This piece of software is a remarkable
        advance; it allows you to cleanly install and de-install
        applications and operating-system components, including the
        kernel and OS base itself.  Red Hat has issued this under GPL,
        which is a good thing for other distributors; it is the
        considered opinion of this editor that those who do not adopt it
        will shortly have their lunches eaten by those who do.

  3.  Submissions To This Document

  I encourage anyone and everyone who maintains a Linux distribution or
  mail order service, to submit information on their service to this
  HOWTO. It's easy and fun, and it's free advertising. This document is
  posted to many places and is archived (see the next section).


  3.1.  Types of Submissions

  We are interested in submissions for:


  ·  Complete distributions of Linux software, available either via
     anonymous FTP, UUCP, or mail order. By `complete distribution' we
     mean any set of software which can be used to build a complete
     Linux system from scratch.

  ·  Layered products or individual software packages available only via
     mail order. If your software package is available via anonymous
     FTP, chances are people can find it. Software products only
     available via mail-order include commercial things such as Motif,
     and any other commercial software ported to Linux.

  ·  Any other Linux-specific goods available via mail order, such as
     Linux-specific books and documentation, T-shirts, and assorted
     paraphrenalia.   Note: our interest in the latter categories is
     marginal -- this is a Linux Distributions HOWTO, not a catalogue of
     cutesy Linux junk.  Whatever you're selling will have to be (a)
     very useful, (b) very original, or (c) very funny, to get listed
     here.

  If the number of submissions for services and layered products is
  large, I'll create a separate HOWTO for these items.


  3.2.  How to submit

  To submit an entry to this HOWTO, please send mail to
  esr@snark.thyrsus.com with the following information. This format is
  not machine-parsable; any of the fields may be any length that you
  wish, but I'd like to keep each entry down to, say, 50 lines.


     Name:
        Name of service or distribution


     Distributor:
        Name of company, person, etc. who distributes/maintains the
        service or distribution.  Should include mail, email, phone
        contact information, and (if possible) a WWW reference.


     Provider's Description:
        Description of the distribution or service that you provide. If
        this is a software distribution, please include information such
        as what software is included, versions, general overview of
        installation, requirements, and so on.


     Internet Access:
        Where your service or distribution is available over the
        Internet; typically a WWW or FTP address.


     Ordering:
        How to order your distribution or service, if applicable.
        Include prices, shipping information, methods of payment, etc.


     Support:
        Information on support terms and support contracts.


     Miscellaneous:
        Anything else that you find relevant.


     Last Freeze Date:
        Last freeze date of the current version(s).  Also, your
        estimated update frequency.


  3.3.  Submission Guidelines

  Please keep your entry as short as possible. If you need to include
  extensive information, please make a reference to where one can FTP or
  mail to get more information on your distribution; these entries are
  only meant to be pointers to where one can find information on your
  service or distribution.

  If you provide more than one service or distribution, please use
  separate entries for each.

  I may edit your entries for conciseness and brevity, if I find any
  irrelevant information, or if the entry is overly verbose.  Otherwise
  the content should remain the same.

  When making submissions to the Distribution-HOWTO, you grant implicit
  permission for me to use the entries in other materials, such as books
  from the LDP, and other online documents. For example, information
  from the Distribution-HOWTO may be included in a published Linux book.
  If you do not want me to include your entry in materials other than
  the Distribution-HOWTO, please say so.


  4.  Administrivia


  4.1.  Terms of Use

  This document is copyright 1997 by Eric S. Raymond. You may use,
  disseminate, and reproduce it freely, provided you:


  ·  Do not omit or alter this copyright notice.

  ·  Do not omit or alter or omit the version number and date.

  ·  Do not omit or alter the document's pointer to the current WWW
     version.


  ·  Clearly mark any consdensed, altered or versions as such.

  These restrictions are intended to protect potential readers from
  stale or mangled versions.  If you think you have a good case for an
  exception, ask me.


  4.2.  Acknowledgements

  This document was originated by Bill Riemers.  Matt Welsh maintained
  the second version.  Erik Troan then maintained the document to
  release 3.0.

  In January 1995, Eric Raymond, while unaware of the existence of this
  document, began to develop a similar FAQ in the format of his now-
  discontinued "PC-clone UNIX Software Buyer's Guide", which had covered
  mainly System V UNIXes and BSD/OS.

  In March 1995, Eric approached Erik about cooperating on a merged
  version.  In early April 1995, Erik went to work for Red Hat Software,
  and (wishing to avoid a conflict of interest) handed the document to
  Eric.  Eric merged in a lot of new information and added several new
  fields to the distribution entries.

  Accordingly, this document has been a sort of serial collaboration.
  The editorial `we' generally tags observations by all the maintainers;
  `I' is Eric (the current one) speaking.

  We are delighted to acknowledge the contributions of all the Linux
  users and Internet hackers who have contributed information and
  feedback.
