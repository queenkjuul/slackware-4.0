  Linux HAM-HOWTO, Amateur Radio.
  Terry Dawson, VK2KTJ, terry@perf.no.itg.telstra.com.au
  v2.3, 1 April 1997

  It is hoped that this document will assist Amateur Radio operators in
  finding and trying the various amateur radio software that has been
  written for or ported to Linux. It is also hoped that as a consequence
  of this information being available that more amateur radio operators
  will choose Linux as the platform of choice for their experimentation,
  and that software developers will choose Linux as the platform for
  their software development, further expanding the role of operating
  systems like Linux in the Amateur Radio field.

  1.  Introduction.

  This list was prompted by comments that had been expressed in the
  various Linux newsgroups about the number of amateur radio operators
  that were involved with Linux. It is now clear that Linux is becoming
  a popular platform for Amateur Radio development work.

  This list was originally called the RADIOLINUX list, but has been
  moved into the Linux Documentation Project HOWTO collection, so it has
  been renamed the HAM-HOWTO. I make no apologies for the name.

  3.2.  SatTrack - Satellite tracking program

     Name
        SatTrack

     Author
        Manfred Bester, DL5KR, manfred@ssl.berkeley.edu, (510) 849-9922

     Description
        Satellite realtime tracking and orbit prediction program with
        X11 color graphics.

     Status
        Version 4.0 is a fully commercial release. Version 3.1.5 is the
        last freely available release.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements
        A vt100 terminal and or X11 server. A Maths Coprocessor is
        useful, but not essential, for good performance.

     Detail
        SatTrack is a satellite tracking program that has been written
        in 'C' language on a UNIX workstation. It provides two different
        live displays, for single or multiple satellites, and two
        different orbit prediction facilities. Cursor controls used in
        both live displays are compatible with the VT100 standard, which
        allows the program to be run basically from any terminal. An
        optional X Window graphics display shows the typical world map
        tracking chart. The orbit prediction can be run either
        interactively or in a batch mode. In the latter case all
        necessary parameters are specified on the command line. The
        program uses the NORAD/NASA two-line Keplerian element (TLE)
        sets directly.

        The current version of SatTrack can track a single satellite
        and/or display multiple satellites for a single ground station.
        It also can control suitable ground station hardware, like
        antennas and radio equipment, and has an autotrack mode in which
        it switches automatically between a number of specified
        satellites. For calibration purposes tracking of the Sun and the
        Moon are also provided. Future releases will provide more
        options. SatTrack requires about 5MB of disk space in the full
        distribution with eight different world maps (2 styles, with 4
        different sizes each, to fit everyone's screen and taste) and
        less than 1.5 MB of memory at run time. More information can be
        obtained from the SatTrack WWW Home Page
        <http://www.primenet.com/~bester/sattrack.html>.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        The commerical version of SatTrack can be found at: SatTrack WWW
        Home Page <http://www.primenet.com/~bester/sattrack.html>.

        The free version of SatTrack may be found at: ftp.jvnc.net
        <ftp://ftp.jvnc.net/priv/kupiec/sattrack/> or ftp.amsat.org
        <ftp://ftp.amsat.org/amsat/software/Linux/>.

     Licensing/Copyright
        The software is Copyright of Manfred Bester. It can be used
        without special permission for non-profit, non-commercial use.
        For commercial applications a license from the author is
        required. Version 4.0 is a fully commercially supported release.

  3.3.  Predict

     Author
        John A. Magliacane, KD2BD, kd2bd@amsat.org

     Description
        A satellite orbital prediction program that also tracks the
        sun's position to predict visible satellite passes.

     Status
        Complete and working.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements
        predict is a screen-oriented program that utilizes the
        ncurses-1.8.5 (or later) library.  A color terminal is a plus,
        but not a necessity.

     Detail
        Features of predict include azimuth and elevation headings of
        satellite passes, orbital phase, sub-satellite point locations,
        slant ranges, orbit numbers, and sunlight visibility as a
        function of date and time. The program is simple, fast, and easy
        to use. Predict maintains an orbital database for 21 satellites
        that can be updated by the user through the keyboard or by using
        files containing NASA 2-line orbital element data. Since this
        program operates under a multiuser environment, each user on the
        system owns and maintains his or her own unique orbital data
        base.

        This program has been compiled using the highest level of
        compiler optimization for high speed execution, and uses an
        a.out binary format for greatest compatibility.

        To install the package use the following:

          # cd /
          # tar xvfz predict.tgz

     Where and How to obtain it.
        You can obtain predict.tgz from: amsat.org
        <ftp://amsat.org/amsat/software/Linux/>

     Licensing/Copyright
        This software is available free of charge and must be used for
        non-commercial purposes only.

        small yagi antenna, and a communications program such as Minicom
        that can save 1200 baud ASCII telemetry data to a text file.

     Detail
        uo11 decodes ASCII telemetry data that has been captured through
        a terminal program, error checks the received data, and applies
        calibration equations to the received data to produce a report
        that can be easily understood and analyzed.  uo11 comes pre-
        compiled (a.out format) with a man page entry for ease of use.

        To install you should use the following commands:

     # cd /
     # tar xvfz uo11.tgz

     System Requirements
        Recommended hardware is 80486/33Mhz with 8MB RAM

     Detail
        Unfortunately the documentation is in German and I'm unable to
        understand most of it. I get the impression though that this is
        a BBS that supports all of the usual features on a packet radio
        bbs, forwarding etc, but the documentation seems to suggest that
        the Linux version supports telnet access only. This isn't really
        a big constraint, as you can easily configure a session under
        the Linux ax25d program to accept AX.25/NetRom/Rose connections
        and connect the BBS via telnet.

        If you're able to help by giving a better description, I'd
        appreciate it.

     Author
        Bob Arasmith, N0ARY, ported to Linux (and others) by Bob Proulx,
        KF0UW, rwp@fc.hp.com

     Description
        A packet bbs implemented under UN*X.
     Status
        ALPHA. Bob is running version ARY-0.9 on both Linux and HP-UX.
        The next version from N0ARY which is called 4.0 is in alpha
        test/development release. Bob has not been able to bring this
        online yet and is still running 0.9+kf0uw mods. Bob has about
        half it working with Alan Cox's AX.25 kernel which would be the
        desirable combination.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System Requirements.
        Linux installation, C Compiler, plus HAM radio TNC hardware.

     Detail
        This bbs has an excellent packet user interface.  It has a
        compatible set of commands with the RLI bbs so users will be
        familiar with it immediately.  It then extends the command set
        to be a very nice natural language style interface (e.g "list at
        allus about KPC-3"). Many csh style bang commands are supported.
        Also included is a mail interface to provide a packet to
        internet gateway.

        Currently you need to customize the source code for your
        installation so you need some C programming proficiency.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        For a Linux version or for Linux information send mail to
        rwp@fc.hp.com. For a SunOS version contact bob@arasmith.com.
        This code is not packaged for distribution yet since it is not
        past the alpha stage of development.

        A version of the software is available from ftp.funet.fi
        <ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/ham/unix/packet/n0ary/>

     Author
        Daryl L Miles, G7LED, dlm@frink.demon.co.uk

     Description
        A BBS package designed to operate with either the native AX.25
        kernel code or with the Wampes package.

     Status
        In development, working.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements
        Kernel AX.25 support or the Wampes package. sendmail, CNEWS.

     Detail
        Daryl's aim was to build a platform on which amateurs could
        build a Packet BBS to smtp gateway for Linux. I'm not sure what
        the current status is as the last version I could find was dated
        30 Jun 1995.  The latest binary version supports:
       MBL, FBB batching, FBB compressed, FBB type 1 compressed
        forwarding with restart facility implemented, deferring, and
        rejection.

       various Linux transport mechanisms including TCP kernel, AX.25
        kernel, Wampes NetROM, AX25 or TCP.

       Simple dialer, to allow connections through AX.25 or NetROM
        nodes.

       White Pages

       Transient handling of type A (ACK messages).

       SMTP/NNTP<>BBS gatewaying implemented heavily to the extent that
        the user front end will be accessing the NetNews spool to
        retrieve articles.

       Message filter mechanism

       Field swapping (like SWAPP.SYS in FBB).

       Multiuser/connect.

        To install, I did the following:

          # cd /usr/src
          # mkdir LBBS
          # tar xvfz LBBS-0.1.6A.tar.gz
          # cd LBBS
          # ./Install.sh

     This created a /usr/lbbs directory. The README.Setup file suggest
     an order in which to configure the BBS.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        You can obtain the `LBBS' package from: ftp.ucsd.edu

  5.15.  CLX Packet DX Cluster Program

     Author
        Franta Bendl, DJ0ZY, and Bernhard ("Ben") Buettner, DL6RAI,
        root@dl6rai.muc.de

     Description
        A PacketCluster like system running on Linux.

     Status
        Current version 2.07

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System Requirements
        Linux Kernel version 2.0 or greater, TCP/IP networking, SysV
        IPC. Also requires Perl and optionally Expect.

     Detail
        PacketCluster nodes have been available for about seven years.
        The original software was written by Dick Newell, AK1A, and is
        running under DOS.  CLX is a system which clones a PacketCluster
        node. To the outside user commands and features are mostly
        identical. Remote PacketCluster nodes, which can be networked,
        don't see the difference between a generic PacketCluster node
        and CLX. So it fits well into an established network of
        PacketCluster nodes.

        CLX is not a user application, it is network node software. As
        such it is not of much use for the individual amateur. SysOPs of
        PacketCluster nodes with some experience on both PacketCluster
        and Linux will find this application interesting.

        Here are some of the features of CLX:

       It is fully compatible with the internal PCxx protocol and from
        a users point of view. It allows multitasking and different
        priorities.

       The software detects looping DX spots without generating endless
        messages. CLX filters out such duplicate information. We have
        implemented a concept which allows us to connect the network at
        multiple points, which would formerly have been called a
        "Cluster Loop". CLX knows of so-called "active" and "passive"
        links. The outcome is that more DX information is seen by CLX
        users.
       An interface for extending CLX with your own programs and
        applications.

       Extended connectivity through the use of connect scripts. CLX
        now can build up and maintain virtually any connection using
        TCP/IP, UUCP or any other communication programs.

       CLX uses modern programming concepts like shared memory for
        common data, lex and yacc to implement command language, shared
        libraries to keep binaries small, remote procedure calls for
        interprocess communication. It is strictly modularized with its
        own dedicated process for every major task.

       Comprises of several modules running as separate processes.

     Where and How to obtain it
        You can obtain the software from ftp.funet.fi
        <ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/ham/unix/Linux/cluster>

        There are five files that make up the package:

          00Index
          clx_206.tgz
          clx.txt
          README

     Licensing/Copyright
        CLX (c) by Franta Bendl (DJ0ZY) and is available for non-
        commercial use, but the authors want to keep track of who is
        using their product, so before you can actually use the software
        you have to ask for an encrypted callsign string to be placed in
        the configuration file. You must send mail to
        clx_us@dl6rai.muc.de to organise this.

     Description
        A suite of programs that provide BBS and Terminal programs for
        Linux.

     Status
        Stable and working.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements
        TNC supporting WA8DED hostmode or KISS protocols.

     Detail
        TNT is a full featured hostmode terminal program. Compiling it
        on Linux is as difficult as untarring the source and typing
        `make'. It provides both a `dumb' terminal and X11 version. It
        comes with some comprehensive documentation which describes its
        features in some detail. Its main features are:

        Multiple sessions:
           TNT supports multiple packet radio connections on virtual
           screens that you can switch between. Each session window
           provides split screen (seperate transmit and receive text)
           operation with a status line. Commands can be entered in
           either a command session, or in any terminal session using a
           command key. Each of the virtual screens can be larger than
           the physical screen and can be scrolled around.

        Data capture, file transfer and logging:
           A number of options are available for logging received text
           to files. You can log transmit, receive or both to a log
           file. You can overwrite or append received data to existing
           files. You can use the `autobin' protocol to transmit or
           receive binary files.

        Remote Shell operation:
           You can provide a shell to remote users so that they can
           access other programs on your computer. You can also run a
           program and direct its input/output to a channel so that
           users can use it.

        Redirection of devices to a channel:
           TNT allows you to redirect input/output from a channel to a
           device, a modem for example.

        Umlaut conversion:
           TNT provides umlaut conversion if necessary.

        Remote mode:
           Remote users can issue command themselves if allowed to do
           so.

        Socket mode:
           You can configure tnt so that it opens a socket for users to
           telnet to that allows them operation just as you have from
           the console. This is useful where your linux machine is on an
           ethernet and you want other terminal on the net to have use
           of your radio.

        New versions will support the Linux kernel AX.25 code.

        DPBOX is a full featured BBS supporting the following features:

       F6FBB, W0RLI, TheBox style forwarding protocols.

       8-bit transparent handling of messages using AutoBIN protocol.

       BBS data compressed to save space on disk, forwarding and
        downloading.

       "Live message capture" off BBS frequency, saves network traffic.

       PACSAT style bulletin broadcast transmitter and receiver.

       up to 200 simultaneous users.

  5.17.  IPIP encapsulation daemon.

     Name
        Mike Westerhof's IPIP encapsulation daemon.

     Author
        Mike Westerhof KA9WSB (original code), then Bdale Garbee N3EUA
        (port to BSD), then Ron Atkinson N8FOW and John Paul Morrison
        (port to Linux), then Bdale rolled it all back together again.

     Description
        A daemon that will allow you to use your linux machine as an
        IPIP encapsulating gateway. Note, this probably isn't necessary
        any more in most installations because recent kernel support a
        kernel device to perform encapsulation.

     Status
        Ron is running this code himself, and the other version have
        been run quite successfully.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements
        KISS TNC, any version of Linux supporting RAW sockets.

     Detail
        If you've ever used an internet gateway from your amateur packet
        radio you have probably been connected by an encapsulation
        gateway of some descpription. Most run KA9Q's NOS and DOS, but
        others run Unix and this daemon. It allows you to encapsulate IP
        within IP, so that you can 'tunnel' IP connections over the
        Internet. The software allows you to connect a KISS TNC to your
        linux machine and to have all datagrams received on it carried
        across the Internet to a similar gateway. Bdale has installation
        instructions in the package.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        This software is available from the col.hp.com
        <ftp:///col.hp.com/hamradio/packet/etc/ipip/ipip.tar.gz> ftp
        site.

     Licensing/Copyright etc.
        Freely distributable, though Bdale asks that if you use the code
        and like it you might send him a QSL card or a postcard.

        instead.

  5.18.  AXIP encapsulation daemon.

     Name
        Mike Westerhof's AXIP encapsulation daemon.

     Author
        Mike Westerhof KA9WSB, ported to Linux by Ron Atkinson N8FOW.

     Description
        A daemon that will allow you to use your linux machine as an
        AXIP encapsulating gateway.

     Status
        Not properly tested, but assumed to work ok.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements
        KISS TNC, any version of Linux supporting RAW sockets.

     Detail
        This daemon is the partner to the IPIP encapsulation daemon. It
        allows you to encapsulate AX.25 frames in IP to carry them
        across the Internet. This is useful for linking AX.25 networks
        in remote areas. Ron has supplied a Makefile for linux, and with
        it the software compiled without errors on my system running a
        recent version kernel. Ron has also written some README files
        which give you the detail necessary to compile the system and
        the original documentation describes how to configure it.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        This software is available in the sunsite.unc.edu ham apps
        directory

     Description
        This is a version of the convers server that allows multiple
        users to simultaneously chat with each other in a round-table
        style conversation. It is compatible with the NOS convers
        servers, but provides extra facilities such as saving/restoring
        of Personal Text and Chanel Topics. Brian Lantz has further
        enhanced the software with additional features.

     Status
        In use of a number of popular convers servers, appears very
        stable.

        RSPF - Radio Shortest Path First routing daemon for Linux

     Author
        Craig Small vk2xlz csmall@triode.apana.org.au

     Description
        An implementation of the Radio Shortest path First routing
        protocol for linux. The daemon supports version 2.2 of the
        protocol which corrects a lot of bugs and problems that were
        present in version 2.1.

     Status
        Alpha - running, needs testing and bug reports. Current version
        is 0.08

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements.
        Requires Alan Cox's kernel based AX.25 code.

     Detail
        This program will allow Linux to become an RSPF router.  It
        addresses some of the quirks of RSPF v2.1, the version in NOS
        which means that it is incompatible with the NOS version. It
        will also allows remote/local queries via a tcp session for
        debugging and diagnostic purposes.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        Current versions are always available from sunsite.unc.edu

  5.21.  Michael Westfall's TTYLINK Daemon

     Name
        ttylinkd - a ttylink daemon for Linux.

     Author
        Michael Westfall, N6KUY, mwestfal@.csci.csusb.edu

     Description
        A split screen terminal program that listens on the ttylink port
        and accepts incoming connection requests.

     Status
        Seems to work fine.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements
        none special.

     Detail
        This is a standalone program that does require you to change the
        configuration of your system at all. If you have root access on
        your machine then you run the program in a VT or in an XTerm and
        it will clear the screen and wait for an incoming connection on
        port 87 (ttylink). When a connection is received it will provide
        you with a split screen display with which to communicate with
        the calling person.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        You can obtain ttylinkd from: sunsite.unc.edu
        <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/ham/ttylinkd.tgz> or
        ftp.ucsd.edu
        <ftp://ftp.ucsd.edu/hamradio/packet/tcpip/incoming/ttylinkd.tgz>.

  5.22.  Craig Small's TTYLINK Daemon

     Name
        ttylinkd - a ttylink daemon for Linux.

     Author
        Craig Small, VK2XLZ, csmall@triode.apana.org.au

     Description
        A daemon to accept a ttylink (port 87) tcp/ip connection and
        convert it into a talk request for a user on the host machine.
        This may also be configured for use with the ax25d program so
        that AX.25 users may also make use of it to connect to you.

     Status
        Alpha, but working.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements.
        Kernel networking support with AX.25 support if desired.

     Detail
        Because the talk protocol is a non-standard, that is it isn't
        actually defined anywhere (except the source), the ttylink
        protocol from NOS has become the defacto standard, at least for
        amateurs, to provide keyboard to keyboard communication over
        tcp/ip. This daemon fills the need for something to answer
        ttylink requests to linux machines.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        You can obtain the latest version of ttylinkd from:
        sunsite.unc.edu <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/ham/> or
        ftp.ucsd.edu
        <ftp://ftp.ucsd.edu/hamradio/packet/tcpip/incoming>.

        An slightly enhanced version of this software is now included in
        the Linux AX25 utilities package.

     Status
        v1.0. Stable but extra development planned.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements
        Linux supported sound card

     Detail
        CW pileup trainer (similar to PED) based on sccw. Up to 9
        stations calling at once with variable CW speed and tone/volume
        to simulate a pileup.  Callsigns are taken from the 1996 CQ WW
        CW contest entry of M6A to add some realism.

        I fed /usr/dict/words to the program and it was quite a chuckle.
        So even if you aren't into Morse it is worth trying out just for
        the giggle.

     Where and How to obtain it.

        standalone textual program, requires gcc to compile

     Detail
        This program takes a textual input and converts it to morse
        encoded characters in the form of a standard Intel HEX file. The
        Hex file can be used to program an EPROM which can then be
        connected to a simple circuit that generates canned messages.
        Possible uses are CW calling machines and CW beacon transmitter
        keyers. There is an accompanying schematic for a keyer circuit
        that works with this software.

        Linux supported soundcard with FM support.

     Detail
        This program generates morse code characters using the
        soundcard.  It does not rely on the Linux virtual console sound
        features and may therefore be used either with X11 or from a
        virtual console. Its features include:

       adjustable frequency

       adjustable volume

       adjustable speed

       adjustable delay

       adjustable group count

       generation of random groups

     Status
        stable, works quite well, unfinished.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements
        Linux, any version

     Detail
        Alan wrote this small program in only an hour. It is quite neat,
        and allows you to play morse at a range of speeds and
        frequencies through the PC internal speaker. You can specify the
        text to be played either from the command line, from a file, or
        the program is capable of generating random character groups. As
        it stands you must invoke the program from a Linux Virtual
        Console, as it relies on certain kernel calls to produce the
        sound, and these don't work as easily from an XTerm. As it
        sounds each character it lists the character in verbal form (Di,
        Dit, Dah etc.) to the screen. Alan is hoping that someone will
        take the code and enhance it with the features he has listed in
        the comments at the head of the source file.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        I've had a large number of responses from people seeking this
        code, so I've obtained Alan's permission to make it available.

        Not yet available.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements.
        Linux compatible hardware, some software will obviously require
        specialised hardware to operate. No additional software should
        be required.

     Detail
        A complete Linux distribution specifically catering for Amateur
        Radio operators. It will include a fully featured Linux
        installationplus a range of amateur radio specific software such
        as those listed in this document. Bruce has detail and updated
        status report available at the LinuxForHams WWW page
        <http://www.rahul.net/perens/LinuxForHams>.  Bruce has been
        extremely busy with the Debian project and this has reduced his
        available time to just about zero. He does still intend to
        pursue this.  Why don't you help out by maintaining one of the
        software packages as Debian packages ? More information from the
        Debian Web Site <http://www.debian.org/>.

     Where and how to obtain it:
        It isn't yet available, details will be made available when it

  13.5.  SunClock

     Author
        John Mackin, john@cs.su.oz.AU

     Description
        A clock that will show you instantly what parts of the globe are
        exposed by sunlight and what parts aren't.

     Status
        Released.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements.
        X-Windows.

     Detail
        sunclock is another of those desktop gadgets that most people
        think look nice but really don't have a lot of use for. I use
        sunclock to obtain an at-a-glance indication of the time
        anywhere in the world.  In its iconic form it sits in a small
        Mercator projection. When maximised it produces the same image
        but obviously larger with slightly more detail.  It also
        displays the date, local time and UTC. sunclock actually
        calculates mathematically what parts of globe are sunlit and
        which aren't, it seems quite accurate, so long as you assume the
        earth has no atmosphere.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        I haven't seen any precompiled sunclock binaries for Linux
        about, so check your nearest archie server. sunclock compiled
        straight out of the box for me.

     Licensing/Copyright
        Public Domain and may be freely copied as long as the notices at
        the top of sunclock.c remain intact.

        Kirk Johnson, tuna@cag.lcs.mit.edu

     Description
        A rotating earth for X-windows root window. It has real life
        shading, and options for geostatic view, and non geostatic view.
        A prettier and more modern version of sunclock but requires a
        bit more processing power.

     Status
        Version 1.0.

     Updated
        01 Apr 97

     System requirements.
        X-Windows.

     Detail
        xearth is a sophisticated program which draws a colour picture
        of the earth onto your X Windows display. It offers either an
        orthographic view as you would see from space or the map like
        mercator projection. You have a number of options in determining
        the behaviour of the view. The details are available from the
        xearth Home Page
        <ttp://www.cs.colorado.edu/~tuna/xearth/index.html> and in the
        documentation which is supplied with the package.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        The source can be obtained from its home site at cag.lcs.mit.edu
        <ftp://cag.lcs.mit.edu/pub/tuna> or just about any X11/contrib
        directory.

     Licensing/Copyright
        Copyright (C) 1989, 1990, 1993 by Kirk Lauritz Johnson. The
        copyright notice included states that xearth is freely

  14.  How to contribute or update an entry.

  I'd like for this list to be as complete and up-to-date as possible.
  So I'm keen to hear about any developments or products that I don't
  already know about, or that the entry is obselete or outdated for.

  What I'd like as a minimum set of requirement would be something like
  the following:

     Name
        The name of the software in question.

     Author
        Who wrote, or ported the software. An email address, or some
        other means of contacting them is also essential.

     Description
        A single line description of what the software does.

     Status
        An indication of the software's status. Is it still in testing?
        Is it a production release? Is it still in the design stage?

     System requirements
        What does the software require to run? Does it require X-
        Windows? Does it need a soundcard? Does it need a certain
        version of kernel? Does it need other software to support it?

     Detail
        I'm not keen on including a large amount of detail on each piece
        of software as this would consume a lot of time reading and
        trying to keep up to date. So instead what I'd like to list is
        what makes this software unique, anything special about it.
        Perhaps its most outstanding features, that sort of thing.

     Where and How to obtain it.
        If the software is freely distributable then ftp details would
        be great.  If it is commercial software then the name of the
        company distributing the software, and an address or telephone
        number. If it is available only by some other means, say mail
        order, then details on where and how to obtain it.

     Licensing/Copyright
        Is the software Copyleft? Copyright? Shareware? Public Domain?
        Restricted in use in any way?

  Don't worry if you don't know all of these details, just send me what
  you do know and I'll list what I can. I'd rather have an incomplete
  listing than no listing at all.

  Please mail any contributions to:

  terry@perf.no.itg.telstra.com.au

  I'd list a packet radio address too but I'm still not properly
  operational again yet after moving house.

  15.  Discussion relating to Amateur Radio and Linux.

  There are various places that discussion relating to Amateur Radio and
  Linux take place. They take place in the comp.os.linux.* newsgroups,
  they also take place on the linux-hams list on vger.rutgers.edu.
  Other places where they are held include the tcp-group mailing list at
  ucsd.edu (the home of amateur radio tcp/ip discussions).
  To join the Linux linux-hams mail list, send mail to:

       Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu

  with the line:

       subscribe linux-hams

  in the message body. The subject line is ignored.

  To join the tcp-group send mail to:

       listserver@ucsd.edu

  with the line:

       subscribe tcp-group

  in the body of the text.

  Note: Please remember that the tcp-group is primarily for discussion
  of the use of advanced protocols, of which tcp/ip is one, in Amateur
  Radio. Linux specific questions should not ordinarily go there.
