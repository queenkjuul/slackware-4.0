Announcing Slackware Linux 4.0!

Check it, yo.  Nearly six months in the making, the latest version of the 
longest running Linux distribution is now available.  Sporting the long-
awaited 2.2 Linux kernel, the K Desktop Environment, and the latest version
of XFree86, Slackware 4.0 is our most advanced *and* user-friendly release
ever.

From the beginning, Slackware has offered a stable and secure Linux 
distribution for UNIX veterans, as well as an easy-to-use system for
beginners.  Slackware includes everything you'll need to run a powerful
server or workstation.  Each Slackware package follows the setup and
installation instructions from its author(s), offering you the most stable
and easily expandable setup.

Here are some of the advanced features of Slackware 4.0:

- Runs the 2.2.6 version of the Linux kernel from ftp.kernel.org

- Generic IDE (bare.i) and SCSI (scsi.s) boot images work work with nearly
     all Intel-based (and compatible) computer systems.  Additional
     precompiled kernels (62 varieties in all) and boot images provide
     specialized support for hardware such as new Adaptec aic7xxx 7890 SCSI
     controllers, parallel-port IDE devices, IBM PS/2 machines with the
     Microchannel bus, SGI Visual Workstations, Symmetrical Multiprocessing
     machines, and much much more.

- Includes additional bootdisks, precompiled kernels, and source for the
  2.2.7 kernel, for those who need its features.

- Slackware 3.9 available for those wishing to continue to run a 2.0 kernel
  based distribution (Slackware 3.9 is a special edition of Slackware 4.0
  that uses the 2.0.37pre10 kernel and the necessary modules and utilities
  to run a 2.0 kernel).

- System binaries linked with the stable libc5 C libraries, version 5.4.46.

- Includes glibc-2.0.7pre6 shared libraries for glibc binary runtime support.

- Latest GNU releases of /bin/true and /bin/false

- XFree86 3.3.3 patch 1, plus X servers for Neomagic and Intel i740 chipsets.

- GhostScript and APS-filter included to support many common PC printers.
  Among these are:
     HP670, HP690, HP850, HP855, HP870, HP890, HP1100 and HP1600

- A complete, robust, and scalable solution for your enterprise-wide 
  computing needs.

- Installs both egcs-1.1.2 and gcc-2.7.2.3 compilers to provide a more
     flexible development environment.  By default, C code compiles with gcc,
     C++ code compiles with egcs (or specify your own site-wide defaults by
     setting the 'gcc' and 'g++' links in /usr/bin).  There's also an 
     optional gcc-2.8.1.tgz binary package.

- Apache 1.3.6 web server with Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support 
  pre-configured to run right out of the box.

  Slackware distribution.

- Updated versions of the Slackware package management tools, making it
  easy to add, remove, upgrade, and make your own Slackware packages.

- Large repository of contributed software compiled and ready to run. This
  includes GNOME 1.0, various window managers, bash 2.02, support for 3Dfx
  gaming cards, JDK, and more (see /contrib).

     apmd_3.0beta3-2, bzip2-0.9.0b, cdrecord-1.6.1, cvs-1.10, e2fsprogs-1.14,
     emacs-20.3, fetchmail-4.6.3, gpm-1.14, gv-3.5.8, ibcs-2.1-981105,
     ipchains-1.3.8, jdk_1.1.7-v1a, libgr-2.0.13, loadlin-1.6a, pciutils-1.10,
     man-pages-1.23, minicom-1.82-3, modutils-2.1.121, net-tools-1.52,
     netkit-routed-0.12, nfs-server-2.2beta40, perl-5.005_03, pidentd-2.8.3,
     pine 4.10, procmail-3.13.1, procps-2.0.2, procinfo-16, python-1.5.1,

     svgalib-1.3.1, kde-1.1.1

- Installs to a native Linux (ext2fs) partition for maximum performance, or
     into a \LINUX directory on an existing Windows FAT/FAT32 partition using
     the Linux UMSDOS filesystem.  With UMSDOS, you can install a complete 
     Linux system without repartitioning your hard drive!

- Another Slackware exclusive:  Slackware's ZipSlack installation option is
     the fastest, _easiest_ Linux installation ever.  ZipSlack provides a 
     full-featured text-based Linux system as a 37 megabyte ZIP archive.  
     Simply unzip on any FAT or FAT32 partition, edit your boot partition in
     the LINUX.BAT batch file, and you can be running Linux in less than five
     minutes.  Even boots on machines with only 4MB of RAM.  The ZipSlack
     installation includes everything you need to network with Linux 
     (including Ethernet, token ring, SLIP and PPP), develop Linux 
     applications with C, C++, and Perl, and extend the system with additional
     software packages such as X.  A ZipSlack system will even fit on a Zip
     disk, so you can carry a personal Linux system with you to run on any
     PC with a Zip drive.
