Added fourmeg.zip package.  This adds an 8 megabyte swap file to ZipSlack,
allowing it to boot on machines with only 4 megabytes of RAM.  Hopefully this
will help make some of those old 386 laptops useful again. :^)

Rebuilt zipslack.zip from current Slackware snapshot, added 'dip' package,
      and added PCMCIA support.
NOTE: This won't allow you to install to a drive connected through a PCMCIA
      card, only to use PCMCIA devices.  Booting Linux on a PCMCIA device
      would require using an initial ramdisk (initrd) with PCMCIA support, and
      my tests here have shown that an initrd doesn't work with a UMSDOS Linux
      system installed in \LINUX.
