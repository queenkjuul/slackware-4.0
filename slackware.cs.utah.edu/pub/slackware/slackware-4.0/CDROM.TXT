Official Slackware Linux Release 4.0 CDROM set.

This is it, the *Official* Slackware(R) Linux CDROM set, created by the
maintainer of Slackware.  Slackware Linux is a UNIX-like 32bit multi-user,
multi-tasking operating system for PC compatible computers.  It supports 
a wide range of software, including C and C++ compilers, programming
libraries, the X Window System, Emacs, and TCP/IP networking. (with 
PPP, SLIP, the Apache web server, and much more!)

This FOUR disc CDROM set contains a huge collection of utilities and 
documentation for Linux, including exclusive enhancements to the Linux
Slackware distribution such as a bootable CDROM with a fully installed
Linux system (the ultimate Linux rescue disc!), and a carefully selected
collection of files from the metalab ftp site -- almost everything ported
to Linux that exists!  If you want the best version of Linux, Slackware
Linux, this is the product for you.  This disc set was made in May 1999.
The price is $39.95.

The Slackware Linux CDROM set is available by subscription.  We update the
Slackware Linux set about every five months.  When we have a new version
we ship them to our subscribers.  We bill your credit card when we ship.
The cost is only $24.95 for Slackware Linux.  The standard shipping charge
