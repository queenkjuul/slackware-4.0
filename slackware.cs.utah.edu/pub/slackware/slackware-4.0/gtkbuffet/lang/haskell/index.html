    <h1>A GTK+ Binding for Haskell</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> (The GIMP Toolkit) is an <a
	href="http://opensource.org/">open source</a> GUI toolkit originally
      developed for the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> 
      (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> Image
	Manipulation Program). However, it is used in a range of other
      projects by now, most notably the <a
      href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> (GNU Network Object Model
      Environment) and the <a
	href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> project (Netscape's open
	source
      browser).  GTK+ is portable as it does not rely on X window's Xt
      library, but instead accesses the underlying window system via a thin
      API, called GDK.  Furthermore, it uses a consequent object-oriented
      design and realizes callback functionality via a flexible and powerful
      signal mechanism (not identical with, but oriented by *nix signals).
      GTK+ object-oriented features are realized in plain C; and it has been
      designed with an eye on making it not too difficult to interface from
      high-level languages.  Therefore, it is a very interesting choice for a
      GUI toolkit for <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell.</a>
    <p>
      The lattest news:
    <ul>
      <li>Experimental support for GtkGLArea.
      <li>The binding know works with GTK+ 1.2 (current stable series of GTK+).
    </ul>
    <p>
      Currently, the GTK+ binding is available for the Glasgow Haskell
      Compiler only.  If you want to have it for another Haskell system, try
      to get <a
      href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/hdirect/ffi-a4.ps.gz">Glasgow's
      New Foreign Function Interface (FFI)</a> implemented in that system.  I
      think, the FFI is a good design and Haskell bitterly needs a protable,
      widely supported foreign function call mechanism.

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>
      The GTK+ Binding for Haskell is currently in an <em>alpha</em> release
      state.  In other words, the basic functionality (including GTK+'s object
      system and the signal mechanism) is implemented and basic widgets (like
      windows and and buttons) are available.  However, more sophisticated
      widgets are missing and the code is only lightly tested.  The following
      widgets (plus some basic widgets) are implemented: horizontal and
      vertical boxes, plain buttons, check buttons, toggle buttons, radio
      buttons, range widgets (scales and scollbars), text entries, labels,
      file selectors, separators, and windows.
    <p>
      The implemented functionality should already be sufficient for simple
      dialogs.  You may want to have a look at the <a
      href="fsel.gif">screenshot</a> and <a href="FileSel.hs">code</a> of one
      of the small examples that I used to test the binding.

    <h2>Releases</h2>
    <p>
      <dl>
      <dt>
	<a href="http://greyarea.is.tsukuba.ac.jp/~chak/haskell/gtk/gtk+hs-0.3.2.tar.gz"

      <dd>
        Works with GTK+ 1.2 and has experimental support for GtkGLArea. To use
        it, you need <a

	4.02</a>; if you are using Linux, you can install the <a

      <dd>
        This is the last alpha release based on GTK+ 1.0; furthermore,
	some  bugs fixed and the system is restructured to reflect
	the decomposition into 
	GLib, GDK, and GTK+. To use it, you need <a
	href="http://research.microsoft.com/users/t-simonm/ghc/download_ghc_402.html">GHC
	4.02</a>; if you are using Linux, you can install the <a

	  ><code>gtk+hs-0.2.1.tar.gz</code></a></dt>
      <dd>
	Second alpha release (includes class hierarchy, signals, and basic
	widgets).  To use it, you need <a
	href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/ghc/download.html#4.01">GHC
	4.01</a> <strong>with</strong> Sven Panne's <a

	Linux, you can install the
	<a href="ftp://greyarea.is.tsukuba.ac.jp/pub/jibunmaki/">RPM for GHC
	4.01 including the patch.</a>  (The forthcoming GHC 4.02 should also
	be ok.) 
      <dt>
	<a href="http://greyarea.is.tsukuba.ac.jp/~chak/haskell/gtk/gtk+hs-0.1.0.tar.gz"
	  ><code>gtk+hs-0.1.0.tar.gz</code></a></dt>
      <dd>
	First alpha release (includes class hierarchy, signals, and basic
	widgets).  Requirements are like for the above.
      </dd>
      </dl>
    <p>
      The files are also available per <a
      href="ftp://greyarea.is.tsukuba.ac.jp/pub/haskell/gtk/">ftp.</a> 
    

    <h2>Future Development</h2>

    The groundwork is laid; next, I plan to add some of the more complex
    widgets (probably, the text widget, scrolled windows, and some basic GDK
    functionality).
    The code is released under the <a
	href="http://org.gnu.de/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU Library General Public
	Lisence.</a> This basically means that you can do whatever you want
	with it, as long as you share any improvements to the library with the
	rest of us.  I welcome everybody to contribute bindings for widgets
	and functions that are not supported yet; I only ask any contributors
	that they code in accordance with the style and design of the existing
	modules.  <em>I will soon add a simple design specification, which
	outlines the basic structure of the binding.</em>
