Usage information: this package was designed to work Gtk+ versions 0.99.10
through 1.1.11, though there is no guarantee it will work with any other
distributions, or indeed even those ones. To build, fully build and install
Gtk in your system (and glib too, if necessary), then run 'perl
Makefile.PL', and 'make test', and then 'make install' if all went well.

You may optionally run Makefile.PL with several different switches to enable
use of some Gtk widgets and Gdk functions available in those packages. These
switches are listed when you run Makefile.PL.

Gtk is available at <ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gtk/>.

The code may very well still have leaks, and a few portions are incomplete
(such as Gdk colormap manipulation) and much of it is untested. No
documentation currently exists, but this code is designed to mimic the C
calling sequences as much as is reasonable.

A major file reorganization happened with 0.1.13, hopefully making the
module easier to work with, and add widgets to, but it may turn out to break
with older Perl installations. A configuration reorgnization occured after
0.3, to try and copy with supporting multiple Gtk versions.

If you have been using Gtk-0.1.8, several changes have been made to the API,
including the change of enumeration and flag values to lowercase (to match
the constants defined in gtk.defs), and the requirement for Gtk->init() to
be invoked before any other Gtk functions.

Please bring information regarding bugs and other issues to
<gtk-list@redhat.com> (before posting, you will need to subscribe to the
list by sending 'subscribe' to gtk-list-request@redhat.com) or the author,
at <kjahds@kjahds.com>. I cannot guarantee, at the moment, that any
particular problem will be fixed.

Good Luck,
Ken
