X-GnuDIP2 Client v1.1

X-GnuDIP2 is released under the GPL. Please see the file COPYING included in this distribution for more information.

X-GnuDIP2 Client is a X client for the GnuDIP2 dynamic dns server package. The tool tips are pretty much self explanitory as what goes where. X-GnuDIP2 does NOT work with versions of GnuDIP under 2.0.1. Please send any bugs and comments to mike@innercite.com or wahle@innercite.com

Please tell your ISP to install GnuDIP so everyone can enjoy in having their own static hostname.

GnuDIP can be found at http://gnudip.cheapnet.net



Thanks to all who have helped test GnuDIP and X-GnuDIP2 Client
