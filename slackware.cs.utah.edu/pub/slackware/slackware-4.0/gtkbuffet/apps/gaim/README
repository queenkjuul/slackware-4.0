Build:

Type "make" to build the stock GTK version.  If you want gtk-themes support,
uncomment "USE_THEMES" in the Makefile.  If you want to build as a gnome 
applet, uncomment USE_GNOME instead.

NB: You need the latest GTK-1.1.  I've been told it compiles under 1.0 but
there's a number of cosmetic problems.  With Gimp 1.1 out, there's no need
to even have 1.0 lying around anymore ;)

Run:

type "./aim"

If you built as a GNOME applet, su to root and run "make install". 
Afterwards panel->add applet->Amusements->Gaim should be there.
Note that the current source will work with GNOME 0.99.2 .  It will NOT work 
with 0.99.1 .  It may work with earlier versions.

Notes:

The import buddy list isn't done, and export just writes to a file gaim-buddy in your
home directory.  Sorry, but this was scratched together as a quick buddy list backup.



This should now compile under Solaris, Digital Unix, Irix, etc w/o a
problem.
This compiles without warnings on Linux-x86 2.0.36 glibc, GTK 1.1.9 system.
If you get warnings on something else, let me know.
If you get errors, upgrade to the latest GTK-1.1 before bothering me.


The resulting executable is standalone, so you can put it in /usr/bin or
whatever.

Send me bug reports.  The web page is http://www.marko.net/gaim and the ftp
site is ftp://ftp.marko.net/pub/gaim

Keep your eyes out for updates, and I'll try to keep the program maintained.
Other contributors and patches are welcomed.


WindowMaker Users:
Having trouble getting the appicon thing working quite right.  I'm not sure
of the deal.  Anyway, here's the best way (I think) to get it working right.
First, when you're in the 'login' screen, go to 'advanced options' under
'attributes' and turn the emulation of app icons ON.
Then, once you're logged in, make sure app icon emulation is OFF on the
buddy window.
When a dialog pops up (either for errors or buddy chat invite), go into it's
attributes, and under 'application specific' set 'no app icon' ON.

Apologies about the pain in the ass.  I'll get this working :)
