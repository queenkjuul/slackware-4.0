LibGTop 0.26.2 has been released:
--------------------------------

This is the latest "official" release of LibGTop that should be used
with GNOME 0.30 - binary RPMS of gnome-core and gnome-utils linked
against it are in the /pub/gnome directory.

All bugs that were reported during the last week should be fixed in
this release, however I don't want to call it 0.30 until GTop 0.30
is released.

Tarballs:

	libgtop-0.26.2.tar.gz

Source RPM:

	libgtop-0.26.2-SNAP.src.rpm

Binary RPMS:

	libgtop-0.26.2-SNAP.i386.rpm
	libgtop-devel-0.26.2-SNAP.i386.rpm
	libgtop-examples-0.26.2-SNAP.i386.rpm
