This directory contains rglclock.  It is being developed inactively,
and should be considered as beta-quality software.

Version 1.1.x is the most stable (but maybe old) release.  Newer
snapshots may be available in the snapshat subdirectory.

Building rglclock from the source code requires a recent C++ compiler,
GTK 1.0, and Mesa or OpenGL libraries.
