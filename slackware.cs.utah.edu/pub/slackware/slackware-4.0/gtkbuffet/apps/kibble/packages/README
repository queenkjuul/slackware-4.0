This is Kibble, a knowledge base program. It is used to organize seemingly
discursive thoughts into a cohesive engine. Basically, it is used it to
keep track of random ideas that may prove useful. It is released under
the GNU General Public License and is Open Source software.

Kibble requires GTK to compile. It may not work with early 1.0.x
releases, YMMV. Statically linked binaries for i386 Linux are available
at ftp://wish.student.harvard.edu/pub/kibble/binaries/.

Kibble has a page on the web.  See:

Kibble currently has an incomplete French translation. If you know
a foreign language, perhaps you could do translate some strings. It
should take no more that ten minutes and it would mean a whole lot to
many users! There are only thirty-five strings that need translation,
and most are duplicates or single words.
