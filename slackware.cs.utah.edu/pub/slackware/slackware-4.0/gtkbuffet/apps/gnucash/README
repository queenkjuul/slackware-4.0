Running:
--------
Only the Motif version of GnuCash is currently functional.  The Gnome version
will give you a taste for Gnome, but most functions will not work.

To be able to use certain features of GnuCash, such as reports and network stock
price downloads, you must have the following packages below installed.
RPM's for most of these can be found at http://rufus.w3.org/linux/

perl    -- Almost any version of perl5 should work.  I run perl-5.004
eperl   -- Almost any version of eperl should work.  I run eperl-2.2.14

In addition, some perl modules need to be installed:

perl-LWP/libwww-perl-5.36
perl-HTML/HTML-0.6
perl-HTML/HTML-Parser-2.20
        -- these perl modules are used to fetch stock & mutual fund quotes
           off the net.  You can pick up RPMS at
           ftp://ftp.gnucash.org/pub/gnucash/binaries/RPMS
           http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/PByName.html
           http://linas.org/linux/xacc (last resort)
           or sources at
           http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html

The binary-only distribution of GnuCash comes with several executables:
one has Motif statically linked in, and another has Motif linked in dynamically.
The motif dynamic-link version requires that either motif or lesstif be
installed.  Motif is a commercial product available form several vendors for
approx $50.  Lesstif is an open source clone available for free. Note that
not all version of lesstif work with Gnucash: thhe the note below.

The binary-only distribution includes two binary files: 'gnucash.bin'
and 'gnucash-static.bin'. The former requires a Motif shared library;
the latter has Motif statically linked in.  If you have Motif,
then just run xacc.  If you do not have Motif, then copy
'gnucash-static.bin' to 'gnucash.bin'.

You can then start GnuCash at the command-line, with
"gnucash" or "gnucash <filename>", where <filename> is a
GnuCash account file.  Sample accounts can be found in
"data" subdirectory.  *.dat files are GnuCash accounts that can
opened with the "Open File" menu entry.  *.qif files are
Quicken Import Format files that can be opened with the
"Import QIF" menu entry.

Important Note:
---------------
Core dumps have been reported when using various
versions of lesstif.  Some versions work, others don't.
Lesstif 0.81: works
Lesstif 0.82: broken
Lesstif 0.86.0: works
Lesstif 0.86.5: broken
Lesstif 0.87.0: broken (missing symbols for XmeDrawShadows, etc.)

These core dumps do not occur with RedHat Motif (or other commercial
versions of Motif).

Building & Installing:
----------------------
These steps does not apply to binary distributions; only to
source distributions.

Prior to building GnuCash, you will have to obtain and install the following
packages:

nana    -- Used to provide a debugging infrastructure.
           Any version should work.
           http://www.fsf.org/software/nana/nana.html
           http://www.cs.ntu.edu.au/homepages/pjm/nana-home/
SWIG    -- Used to autogenerate perl, tcl, guile wrappers.
           available at www.swig.org need 1.1p5 or later ...
guile   -- Provides main extension language infrastructure.
           This is used extensively in gnucash for initialization & startup.
           need version 1.3 or later ( or build 1998.08.18 or 1998.09.10 or later) ...
           ftp://ftp.gnucash.org/pub/gnucash/extra_libs/TAR/guile-core-19980818.tar.gz
           guile-core-19980818-1.i386.rpm works
           guile-1.3.1-1 from redhat.com/pub/rawhide works ...
eperl   -- embeddedPerl needed for Reports.  The menu item "Reports" will not
           work witout this.
           version eperl-2.2.14 works well with perl 5.00404
           http://www.engelschall.com/sw/eperl/
           ftp://ftp.ultra.net/pub/eugene/RPMS/i386/eperl-2.2.14-1.i386.rpm


Motif or Lesstif  --
           Lesstif 0.81    works
           Lesstif 0.82    broken
           Lesstif 0.83    works
           Lesstif 0.86.0  is reported to work
           Lesstif 0.86.5  crashes.
           Lesstif 0.86.9  works ... but some menus come out 2 pixels high.
           Lesstif 0.87.0: broken (missing symbols for XmeDrawShadows, etc.)
           Commercial Motif seems to work, but beware old libXm's
           combined with new glibc's,

XmHTML  -- Provides HTML display capabilities. Used for Help Dialogues, Reports.
           version 1.1.4 or later
           http://www.llp.fu-berlin.de/lsoft/F/5/XMHTML.html
           http://www.xs4all.nl/~ripley/XmHTML/XmHTML.html
           ftp://ftp.ultra.net/pub/eugene/RPMS/i386/XmHTML-1.1.5-1.i386.rpm
           ftp://ftp.ultra.net/pub/eugene/SRPMS/XmHTML-1.1.5-1.src.rpm

libpng  -- portable network graphics library
libjpeg -- JPEG image handling library
libz    -- compression library
xpm     -- X Pixmap extension

perl-LWP/libwww-perl-5.36
perl-HTML/HTML-0.6
perl-HTML/HTML-Parser-2.20
        -- these perl modules are used to fetch stock & mutual fund quotes
           off the net.  You can pick up RPMS at
           http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/PByName.html
           http://linas.org/linux/xacc (last resort)
           or sources at
           http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html

Normally, to build and install GnuCash, all you have to do is:

  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install

You can build Motif, Gnome, and Qt versions. Currently, the Motif version
is the most stable, bug-free, correct, and feature rich.  The gtk/gnome
version compiles and is being actively developed, but will take a while to
reach the stibility level of the motif version. The Qt version may not
compile.

Depending on your make target, you'll produce:

  gnucash.motif
  gnucash.motif.static
  gnucash.gnome
  gnucash.gnome.static
  gnucash.qt

Supported OS's:
---------------
GnuCash version 1.1.x is known to work in the following configs:

Linux 2.x.x           -- Intel  w/ RedHat Motif
FreeBSD               -- Intel
OpenBSD               -- Intel

Xacc-1.0.18, the predecessor to GnuCash, is known to work on the following
platforms:

Slackware 3.4         -- Intel  w/ Mootif (OSF Motif 2.0.1)
Linux 2.x.x           -- Intel  w/ Lesstif v0.81
SGI IRIX              -- MIPS
IBM AIX 4.1.5         -- RS/6000   http://www-frec.bull.com/

See ftp://ftp.gnucash.org/pub/xacc (high-bandwdith)
or  http://linas.org/linux/xacc (slowwww )
for precompiled binaries for these platforms

GnuCash seems to be having problems with:
Solaris -- Sparc  -- won't compile due to va-args in XmHTML

Additional Download Sites:
--------------------------
All of the precompiled binaries & the latest source versions can be found
at http://linas.org/linux/xacc  However, it is recommended that the master
sites for each particular binary be used instead, for two reasons:
1) bandwidth
2) OS-specific info & support
