Welcome to the GtkSheet ftp site
The connection could be slow...

The last version of GtkSheet compiles under gtk+-1.2.0
GtkSheet-5.7 runs only under gtk+-1.0.x

GtkSheet has moved to gtk+-1.2 and new features have been added.
The new distribution includes a set of new widgets.

GtkSheet is a matrix widget for Gtk+. It consist of an scrollable grid of
cells where you can allocate text which can be edited interactivelly. It is
also a container subclass so it allows you to display buttons, curves,
pixmaps and any other widget in it. You can also set many attributes as:
border, foreground and background color, text justification, etc. GtkSheet
comes also with an extra set of useful widgets: GtkComboBox, GtkColorCombo,
and GtkBorderCombo. A demo program shows all of them interacting in a 
spreadsheet-like GUI.

GtkSheet Xtra Widgets Set
=========================
GtkComboBox: 
============
Derived from Paolo Molaro's GtkCombo, it consists of a button, an arrow button,
and a popup window with a frame, that can contain a widget which is displayed
with the arrow. You can pack any widget in the frame (e.g. GtkCalendar).
It has been thought to be a parent class for the following widgets: 

GtkColorCombo:
==============
It's a GtkComboBox subclass with a pallette of colors diplayed in a table.

GtkBorderCombo:
==============
It's a GtkComboBox subclass with a set of border patterns displayed in a table.
