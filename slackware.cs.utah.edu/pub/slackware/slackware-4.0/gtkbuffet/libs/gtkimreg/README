Select an area in an image given as GdkImlib structure and
obtain the coordinates of this image.

The widget represents an image with a mouse drawn rubber box.
The enhancement against other rubber boxes is that you can
type the coordinates manually if you want and can gain an
enhancement in pixel-wise exactness
It was used in paul to cut images and to insert thumb-nails
into clickable maps.
