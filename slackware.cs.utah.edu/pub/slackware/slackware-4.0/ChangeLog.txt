                          loop if a package to be upgraded doesn't match any
                          installed package name.

slakware/a2/grep.tgz:  fgrep and egrep links replaced with actual binaries,
      since it seems this trick no longer works with grep-2.3.  NOTE:  This
      was a fairly major bug, and was impacting all sorts of things in subtle
      (but bad) ways, so if you've encountered problems with libtool, configure
      scripts, or get weird "missing prototypes" errors when you compile things,
      this could be the cause.  Anyone who installed the previous grep package
      in the week that it was out has a broken system, and should upgrade to
      this package immediately.  Since 'installpkg' itself uses grep, install
      the package twice to ensure everything goes into place properly.

----------------------------
Thu Apr  8 01:29:03 CDT 1999

                         timezone.
slakware/n6/rsync.tgz:  Upgraded to rsync-2.3.1.  (security fix:  Old version
                        could cause changes to the permissions of the remote
                        $HOME directory, in rare circumstances)
slakware/n8/tcpip1.tgz:  For improved security, in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2, show
                         named -u daemon -g daemon (example, commented out).
slakware/x1/xbin.tgz:  Upgraded to rxvt-2.4.11.

slakware/n5/sendmail.tgz:  Recompiled along with the new procmail.
slakware/xap1/libgr.tgz:  Upgraded to libpng-1.0.3 and zlib-1.1.3.
----------------------------

slakware/d1/perl.tgz:  Simplified some of the paths under /usr/lib/perl5/.
slakware/xap1/gimp.tgz:  Upgraded to gimp-1.0.4.
----------------------------
Mon Apr  5 18:09:39 CDT 1999
slakware/a1/bsdlpr.tgz:  Changed default printer in /etc/printcap from
                         /dev/lp1 to /dev/lp0.

                      /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root if it already exists.

slakware/n5/sendmail.tgz:  Recompiled along with the new procmail.
slakware/n7/samba.tgz:  Recompiled against linux-2.2.5 headers.  Do not link
                        against -lshadow (libc has compatible functions already)
                        Added comment about security= to the smb.conf-sample.
----------------------------
Sat Apr  3 00:29:13 CST 1999
bootdsks.144/sgivis.s:  Added bootdisk that supports the SGI Visual Workstation
                        models 320 and 540.  The kernel also supports Adaptec

                        video frame buffer graphics console.

slakware/xap1/gimp.tgz:  Upgraded to gimp-1.0.3, with glib-1.2.1 (thread
                         support enabled), gtk+-1.2.1, and aalib-1.2.  Also
                         includes gimp-data-extras-1.0.0.

                           Make sure to use 'rdev -r vmlinuz 0' on the

slakware/n9/tcpip2.tgz:  Upgraded to dhcp-2.0b1pl18.
                         Added dhcpcd-1.3.17-pl5.
                         Patched netwatch to compile on 2.2.x machines.
                         Patched sliplogin to compile on 2.2.x machines.
slakware/xv1/xvol32.tgz:  Renamed /usr/openwin/bin/msgfmt to
                          /usr/openwin/bin/msgfmt-openlook so various
                          ./configure scripts stop mistaking this for GNU
                          msgfmt.
kernels/net.i/*:  Recompiled including original ARCnet driver.
bootdsks.{12,144}/net.i:  Rebuilt from new ARCnet enabled kernel.
----------------------------
Sun Mar 28 01:18:06 CST 1999
slakware/a4/elflibs.tgz:  Move libc and libm into place in a way that shouldn't
                          confuse the new implementation of UMSDOS quite as
                          much.  (Doesn't seem like the UMSDOS implementation
                          in 2.2.x has completely stabilized, IMHO; but we
                          can work around the problems, at least during the
                          installation process)
slakware/d1/libc.tgz:  Similar anti-UMSDOS-confusion changes.
slakware/n4/ppp.tgz:  Fixed broken /usr/man/man8/pppd.8.gz symlink.
slakware/xap1/gchess.tgz:  Upgraded to gnuchess-4.0.pl79 and xboard-4.0.2.
                           Added menu link to KDE.
----------------------------
Sat Mar 27 17:46:30 CST 1999
contrib/emacspeak-9.0.tgz:  Upgraded emacspeak to version 9.0.
rootdsks/color.gz, pcmcia.gz, text.gz, umsdos.gz:  Use /tmp space on the
         target partition whenever possible.  This prevents the installation
         system from running out of /tmp space from large tagfiles or
         installation scripts.  On the UMSDOS rootdisk, umssync in /mnt in
         addition to /mnt/linux.  (but in /mnt, don't recurse).  This is
         required to prevent the 2.2.x kernel from complaining if the
         permissions on the /mnt/linux/ directory itself are changed.  
bootdsks.144/.eltorito/eltorito.img:  Merged changes from new color.gz.
slakware/a7/lilo.tgz:  Enabled text-mode configuration menus from text.gz,
                       Added liloconfig.tty script to start liloconfig in
                       text mode.
slakware/a12/shadow.tgz:  Upgraded to shadow-19990307.  Fixed non-Y2K date
                          entry in /usr/sbin/adduser.  (It still worked the
                          other way, but wasn't politically correct :)
slakware/y1/bsdgames.tgz:  Removed extra '%' from beginning of 
                           /usr/games/lib/fortunes/linuxcookie, rebuilt the
                           linuxcookie.dat file.
----------------------------
Fri Mar 26 20:07:41 CST 1999
slakware/n7/samba.tgz:  Added /usr/lib/samba/private/mksmbpasswd.sh to help
                        set up the SMB password file.  Also put a README file
                        in there with a pointer to information on enabling
                        plain text password authentication with Win95 and Win98
                        clients.
----------------------------
Thu Mar 25 23:26:59 CST 1999
slakware/n4/netatalk.tgz:  Upgraded to netatalk-1.4b2+asun2.1.3.
----------------------------
Thu Mar 25 20:53:09 CST 1999
slakware/a3/bin.tgz:  Removed support for XIAFS, since it's no longer supported
                      in Linux 2.2.x.
                      Patched 'eject' to compile under 2.2.x.
                      Upgraded to hdparm-3.5.
slakware/a5/hdsetup.tgz:  Patched 'removepkg' to use $ROOT variable for
                          removing packages from filesystems other than /.
slakware/a5/pnp.tgz:  Upgraded to isapnptools-1.18.
slakware/a7/ibcs2.tgz:  SMP iBCS module moved into /lib/modules/2.2.3/smp/,
                        where 'depmod -a' won't complain about it at boot time
                        on non-SMP machines.  If SMP is detected, the SMP
                        module will be loaded from the new location.
slakware/a8/procps.tgz:  Upgraded to procps-2.0.1.
slakware/a10/sysvinit.tgz:  Added section to rc.S for comfiguring ISA 
                            Plug-and-Play devices.
slakware/a13/util.tgz:  Upgraded to util-linux-2.9i.
                        Removed /bin/kill, since there's now a better one
                        included in the procps package.
slakware/n4/ppp.tgz:  Upgraded to ppp-2.3.6.
----------------------------
Wed Mar 24 20:00:19 CST 1999
slakware/a4/elflibs.tgz:  Added /usr/lib/libz.so.1.0.4.
slakware/d1/autoconf.tgz:  Added GNU autoconf-2.13.
slakware/d1/automake.tgz:  Added GNU automake-1.4.
slakware/d1/lthreads.tgz:  Added linuxthreads-0.71.
slakware/n8/tcpip1.tgz:  Fixed idecrypt.8.gz man page.
slakware/tcl1/tcl.tgz:  Upgraded to tcl-8.0.5.
slakware/tcl1/tk.tgz:  Upgraded to tk-8.0.5.
slakware/tcl1/tclx.tgz:  Upgraded to tclX-8.0.4.

slakware/a2/etc.tgz:  Now that netscape is in /usr/lib/netscape, MOZILLA_HOME
                      needs to be set for Java to work properly.  So, this is
                      now defined in /etc/profile:
                      export MOZILLA_HOME=/usr/lib/netscape
                      Similarly, this is now defined in /etc/csh.login:

                         (apparently the last line isn't parsed correctly
                         without it)

slakware/ap1/diff.tgz:  Fixed diff's -l option to use /usr/bin/pr instead
                        of /bin/pr.
slakware/x1/x3dl.tgz, x8514.tgz, xagx.tgz, xbin.tgz, xdoc.tgz, xfb.tgz,

contrib/ircd.tgz:  Upgraded to the Undernet IRCD ircu2.10.05.9.  Special thanks
                   to David Cantrell for downloading this, getting it running,
                   and doing most of the work on the build scripts (on a laptop
                   while we were at LinuxWorld, no less :)
slakware/d1/binutils.tgz:  Upgraded to binutils-2.9.1.0.19a.

Fri Mar 12 20:02:59 CST 1999
slakware/n7/samba.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-2.0.3.
            [NOTE: This package has grown quite a bit, and no longer fits on a
             floppy.  As a result, I'm considering collapsing the N series into
             a single directory and letting the packages grow larger than a
             floppy disk.  I know this creates problems for people who still use
             floppy installation, but splitting up packages into floppy sized
             chunks creates problems for everyone else, and is a major 
             maintenance hassle. ]
slakware/xap1/libgr.tgz:  .soname for JPEG library v6b changed from
             libjpeg.so.6.0.1 to libjpeg.so.62.0.0 to avoid a conflict with
             the v6a libjpeg.so.6.0.1 supplied by KDE.
slakware/xap1/gimp.tgz:  Recompiled against the fixed libgr.tgz -- loading
             JPEGs in GIMP under KDE now works correctly.
----------------------------
Thu Mar 11 23:37:15 CST 1999
slakware/a10/sysvinit.tgz:  Edited /etc/rc.d/rc.6 to use the -p option with
                            halt.  This enables APM shutdown with 2.2.x kernels.

slakware/a2/etc.tgz:  Patched /usr/bin/filesize to work on filenames containing
                      whitespace.  Thanks to René Seindal for pointing out

slakware/n8/tcpip1.tgz:  Upgraded to wu-ftpd-2.4.2-beta-18-vr14.
     [The last rebuild of this package was compiled using the header files from
      Linux-2.2.1.  For some reason, this caused wu-ftpd-2.4.2-beta-18-vr12 to
      hangup the FTP session as soon as the 'ls' command was used.  Upgrading to

Wed Feb 10 14:15:11 CST 1999
slakware/n8/tcpip1.tgz:  Upgraded to pop3d-1.006d.  Changed POP spool directory
                  from /var/tmp/.pop to /var/spool/tmp (I couldn't think of any
                  good reason to be hiding it in /var/tmp)  Prevent a local POP
                  DoS by changing POP spool permissions from 1777 to 1775.
                  Added /usr/sbin/flushpop.sh to remove stale POP files from
                  /var/spool/pop -  run it from root's crontab every 15 minutes.

Upgraded X package series to XFree86 3.3.3:
slakware/x1/diskx1, maketag, maketag.ez, tagfile, tagfile.org: edited.
slakware/x1/x3dl.tgz, x8514.tgz, xagx.tgz, xbin.tgz, xcfg.tgz, xdoc.tgz,

slakware/xap1/kde.tgz:  Added KDE package.  (KDE is a network transparent
    contemporary desktop environment for UNIX workstations)  Note that use of
    KDE-1.0 may open up some local security holes.  BugTraq recently reported
    one with the KDE screensaver, for example.  Still, KDE is pretty nice. :)
    These security problems will likely be gone in the next KDE release.
----------------------------
****** branched slackware-current development tree here ******
----------------------------
Sat Nov 28 17:28:23 CST 1998

kernels/pportide.i/bzImage:  (bugfix)  Added missing parallel-port IDE drivers.
----------------------------

----------------------------

slakware/a10/sysvinit.tgz:  Patched /etc/rc.d/rc.M to start apmd on laptops.
slakware/ap1/ghostscr.tgz:  Added support for HP HP670, HP690, HP850, HP855,
         HP870, HP890, HP1100 and HP1600 color printers.
slakware/xap1/fvwm95.tgz:  Added a sample system.fvwm95rc-apm-battery in
         /var/X11R6/lib/fvwm95/.  This version adds a power meter to the
         fvwm95 button bar.
slakware/xap1/gs_x11.tgz:  Added support for HP HP670, HP690, HP850, HP855,

----------------------------
Mon Oct 26 03:22:25 CST 1998
slakware/ap1/manpages.tgz:  Rebuilt /usr/man/whatis.

slakware/xap1/gimp.tgz:  Upgraded to gtk+-1.0.6 and gimp-1.0.2.
----------------------------
Sun Oct 25 18:55:45 CST 1998
Package directories in A and N package series sorted to allow A directories
to fit on 1.2MB or 1.44MB floppies, and N directories to fit on 1.44MB floppies.
slakware/a1/aaa_base.tgz:  Pine requires that /var/spool/mail be chmod 1777 for
            correct mailbox locking.  While I have some reservations about
            allowing yet another place for users to hide huge files, I've made
            the change as there are good technical reasons behind it -- the
            previous more restrictive permissions could result in lost mail.
slakware/a3/bin.tgz:  Upgraded /usr/sbin/makewhatis to version 1.0h.
slakware/a4/less.tgz:  /usr/bin/lesspipe.sh edited to use new '-y' option for
            viewing bzip2 decompressed tar files.
slakware/a5/hdsetup.tgz:  In /usr/lib/setup/cpkgtool, "disk sets" renamed to
            "package series" in a few places.  SeTconfig now sets mail spool
            permissions to 1777.
slakware/ap1/manpages.tgz:  Upgraded to man-pages-1.21.
slakware/x1/x332prog.tgz:  In /var/X11R6/lib/config, the files Imake.tmpl,
            Motif.tmpl, and Motif.rules are all the Lesstif versions now, as
            these are the ones most commonly used with Linux.  Commercial
            versions of Motif should install their own Motif.tmpl and 
            Motif.rules, but we retain the OSF versions that ship with XFree86
            just in case (with a .osf extension). 
rootdsks/color.gz, pcmcia.gz, umsdos.gz:  Changed "setup" to create the mail
            spool directory with correct permissions for file locking.
----------------------------

                         or xcpustate (both pretty useless, IMHO).
slakware/a8/scsi.tgz:  Upgraded generic SCSI Linux kernel to 2.0.35.
slakware/a8/scsi.cfg:  .config file to produce generic 2.0.35 SCSI kernel.
slakware/a10/sysvinit.tgz:  Patches to /etc/rc.d/rc.cdrom.

                        support some parallel-port CD-R/RW drives (with an EPP
                        port 2x might work, and 1x should be pretty reliable)
slakware/n5/samba.tgz:  Removed smbmount/smbumount man pages (these versions
                        won't be used until 2.2.x is the default kernel).
slakware/n6/tcpip2.tgz:  Upgraded to fetchmail-4.6.3 and ipchains-1.3.5.

  x332s3v.tgz, x332svga.tgz, x332vfb.tgz, x332vg16.tgz, 
  x332w32.tgz:  Upgraded to XFree86 3.3.2 + patch 3.
slakware/xd1/x332lkit.tgz:  Upgraded to XFree86 3.3.2 + patch 3.
slakware/x1/x332bin.tgz:  Recompiled 'makedepend' to look for include files in
         the gcc-2.7.2.3 include directory instead of the default gcc-2.7.2.1
         include directory.
contrib/extra-X-servers/:  Added binary-only (even though I'm disappointed to
                see that) X servers for Intel i740 AGP and NeoMagic chipsets.

slakware/a6/modutils.tgz:  Upgraded to modutils-2.1.121.
slakware/a6/pcmcia.tgz:  Upgraded to pcmcia-3.0.5.
slakware/a7/modules.tgz:  New modules for linux-2.0.35.
slakware/a9/modules.tgz:  New modules for linux-2.0.35.
slakware/ap1/ispell.tgz:  Compressed info file.
slakware/d1/egcs.tgz:  Changed the filenames and links in /usr/bin to allow a
         more peaceful coexistence with gcc-2.7.2.3.  'gcc' and 'g++' are now
         links to a longer filename including the compiler's version number.
slakware/d1/gcc.tgz:  Added gcc-2.7.2.3.  Although I never encountered any
         problems with egcs (well, other than the annoying string.h warnings :)
         many of the kernel developers feel that compiling the kernel with a
         gcc-2.7.x compiler is better tested and possibly more reliable.  As a
         result, gcc-2.7.2.3 is now provided as an alternative to egcs-1.0.3.
         When this package is installed in addition to egcs-1.0.3, then by
         default C code will be compiled with gcc-2.7.2.3, while C++, 
         objective C, and Fortran-77 will be compiled with egcs-1.0.3.  If you
         need to change this, aim the 'gcc' and 'g++' links at the compilers
         you want to use, or set the compiler name in your Makefile to the
         compiler you want, such as: GCC=gcc-egcs-1.0.3
slakware/d1/svgalib.tgz:  Upgraded to svgalib-1.3.0.
slakware/n1/apache.tgz:  Upgraded to apache-1.3.3.  Changed server root 
            directory from /var/lib/httpd to /var/lib/apache.

----------------------------
Wed Oct  7 16:28:29 CDT 1998
slakware/ap1/texinfo.tgz:  Inserted missing info.1.gz manpage.
                           (hey, you could have just done "info info" ;^)
slakware/tcl1/tclx.tgz:  Fixed a couple of manpages/symlinks in /usr/man/man1.
----------------------------
Tue Oct  6 23:04:56 CDT 1998

Tue Oct  6 15:19:12 CDT 1998
slakware/d1/libc.tgz:  Use uio.h in the kernel instead of the libc5 version:
                       /usr/include/sys/uio.h -> /usr/include/linux/uio.h
----------------------------
Mon Oct  5 19:45:13 CDT 1998
slakware/a2/elflibs.tgz:  Upgraded to libc-5.4.46.
slakware/d1/libc.tgz:  Upgraded to libc-5.4.46.  (Since this is the final
                       release of libc5, I'd like to take this opportunity
                       to thank H.J. Lu for his years of work on the project,
                       and to wish him well in all future endeavors! :)

slakware/xap1/tagfile, tagfile.org: edited.
----------------------------
Sat Oct  3 18:15:40 CDT 1998
slakware/a3/bin.tgz:  Patched rpm2targz so that the converted .tar.gz files
        do not produce a "decompression OK, trailing garbage ignored" error.
        Added "rpm2tgz" mode to produce output files with a .tgz extension.
----------------------------
Fri Oct  2 16:51:32 CDT 1998
slakware/a8/sysvinit.tgz: Moved to directory a10.
slakware/a8/diska8: edited.
slakware/a10/sysvinit.tgz: Moved here from directory a8.
        /sbin/init has been recompiled as a static binary.  This avoids problems
        with the root partition not getting unmounted correctly at reboot time
        with the latest development kernels.  (The problem was caused by init
        mmap()ing /etc/ld.so.cache before the file is deleted and then rebuilt.
        This leaves init holding a file descriptor to a deleted file at 
        shutdown, preventing it from being unmounted, and leaving the filesystem
        in an inconsistent state.
slakware/a10/diska10: edited.
----------------------------
Thu Oct  1 10:25:50 CDT 1998
slakware/a1/bzip2.tgz:  Upgraded to bzip2-0.9.0b.
slakware/a1/diska1:  edited.
slakware/a4/gpm.tgz:  Fixed a typo in the comments added to /etc/rc.d/rc.local.
slakware/a10/tar.tgz:  The option for bzip2 compression with tar has been
                       changed from -I to -y.  (The long-form options, --bzip2
                       and --bunzip2, will remain the same)
----------------------------
Wed Sep 30 13:54:22 CDT 1998
slakware/n7/tcpip1.tgz:  It appears a new denial-of-service attack against
                         the NFS daemon rpc.mountd has surfaced.  This package
                         upgrades the NFS daemons to nfs-server-2.2beta37,
                         which should fix the problem.
slakware/n7/diskn7: edited.
----------------------------
Tue Sep 22 22:20:25 CDT 1998
contrib/glibc-devel-2.0.5c.tgz:  Added missing /usr/include/gnu/stubs.h.
----------------------------
Fri Sep 18 14:14:39 CDT 1998
slakware/a2/elflibs.tgz: Fixed /lib/libgdbm.so.1.7.3 that was missing
                         some symbols.
----------------------------
Thu Sep  3 22:02:34 CDT 1998
rootdsks/color.gz, umsdos.gz, pcmcia.gz:  Patched setup program to mount
         mount source partitions as read-only when using NFS or a hard-drive
         partition as the installation source.
slakware/a4/hdsetup.tgz: Make setup mount all source partitions read-only.
----------------------------
Thu Sep  3 20:27:12 CDT 1998
slakware/a4/gpm.tgz: Upgraded to gpm-1.14.  In addition, the gpm setup
            script no longer adds the '-R' option to the gpm command line
            in /etc/rc.d/rc.local -- too many people had trouble with this.
            Instead, it adds a commented out example of how to use '-R' with X.
slakware/a4/diska4: edited.
----------------------------
Tue Sep  1 20:11:47 CDT 1998
slakware/a6/diska6: edited.
slakware/a6/minicom.tgz: Upgraded from minicom-1.80.1 to minicom-1.81.1.
                         Minicom changed from setuid root to setgid uucp.
                         (the /dev/cua* devices are rw for group uucp)
slakware/a8/sysvinit.tgz: /etc/rc.d/rc.M edited to start netatalk after
                          initializing TCP/IP.
slakware/a11/util.tgz: Upgraded to use /bin/hostname from net-tools-1.45.
slakware/n7/tcpip.tgz: Patched NFS (rpc.mountd and rpc.nfsd) against security
                       holes reported on BugTraq.
                       Upgraded net-tools-1.432 to net-tools-1.45.
                       Upgraded netkit-routed-0.10 to netkit-routed-0.12.
----------------------------
Fri Aug 21 22:26:57 CDT 1998
slakware/y1/bsdgames.tgz:  Renamed a couple of files:
        cd /usr/games/lib/fortunes
        mv limerick limerick-o
        mv limerick.dat limerick-o.dat
        'limerick' was a new fortune database with the last update of this 
        package.  Many of them could be considered offensive, but in spite of
        the rot13 encryption present in the file, fortune doesn't realize it's
        a potentially offensive database without the '-o' suffix, so people
        were getting these at random, especially if some of the larger 
        alternate databases (like fortunes2) were removed.  Anyway, sorry.
        Hope nobody was too terribly shocked. :^)
----------------------------
Wed Aug 19 17:08:06 CDT 1998
slakware/n7/tcpip1.tgz:  /usr/sbin/rpc.pcnfsd:  Security patches merged in.
                           This daemon is not enabled by default, but if you've
                           enabled it in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 then you will need
                           this new version.
                         /usr/sbin/rpc.portmap:  Host access control added.
----------------------------
Mon Aug 17 13:47:18 CDT 1998
contrib/glibc-devel-2.0.5c.tgz:  Added missing header files in /usr/include.
----------------------------
Sun Aug 16 15:02:58 CDT 1998
slakware/a2/find.tgz:  Directory ownership on /var/spool/locate changed to
                       user nobody, group bin.  This fixes the updatedb cron
                       job that runs as user nobody.
                       (chown nobody.bin /var/spool/locate)
----------------------------
Sat Aug 15 17:41:34 CDT 1998
rootdsks/color.gz, umsdos.gz, pcmcia.gz:  Fixed a bug in 'setup' that can
       result in lost files on a DOS/Windows partition if you use it as the
       source (with the "install from a hard drive partition" option), enter
       an incorrect directory path to the packages, and then attempt to 
       reselect the source within the same run of setup.
slakware/a4/hdsetup.tgz:  Although there doesn't seem to be any way for the
       above bug to occur from with the hard-drive version of setup (where
       a source DOS/Win partition will already be mounted within the 
       directory structure), it's been patched in hdsetup.tgz anyway.
----------------------------
Thu Jul 30 14:29:41 CDT 1998
slakware/tcl1/tcl.tgz: Man pages fixed.  (man.macros needed to be included
                       for correct formatting)
slakware/tcl1/tk.tgz: Man pages fixed.
----------------------------
Thu Jul 16 14:26:13 CDT 1998
rootdsks/color.gz, pcmcia.gz, umsdos.gz: Patched to fix a possible problem
         when installing from a hard drive partition or pre-mounted directory.
slakware/a4/hdsetup.tgz: Patched the same problem in the hard drive version of
                         "setup" although it's not likely to affect an 
                         installed system anyway.
slakware/f1/maketag, maketag.ez: Changed menu choice from incorrect "howto1"
                         to "howto".
----------------------------
Tue Jul 14 11:42:57 CDT 1998
slakware/a2/elflibs.tgz: Removed bogus declarations of snprintf() and
                         vsnprintf() from libdb.so.1.85.4.  (these could 
                         interfere with the secure versions in libc.so
                         depending on the link order used at compile time)
slakware/d1/libc.tgz: Removed bogus declarations of snprintf() and vsnprintf()
                      from libdb.so.1.85.4 and libdb.a.
----------------------------
Thu Jun 25 15:38:02 CDT 1998
slakware/a4/hdsetup.tgz: Fixed 'lilo' bootdisk creation in /sbin/makebootdisk.
slakware/n3/mailx.tgz: Applied buffer-overflow patch from BugTraq.

slakware/ap1/vim.tgz: This actually needs to be compiled on a system with no
                      X libraries or it links with X and Motif even if you
                      specify --disable-gui and --disable-x.  Bad.

slakware/a2/bin.tgz: Remove /sbin/dosfsck.  IMHO, it's unwise to defragment DOS
                     partitions from Linux, when perfectly good tools (which

----------------------------
Wed Mar 25 00:53:34 CST 1998
slakware/a1/aaa_base.tgz: Reverted to mtools-3.8, since mformat in version

Change to structure of /slakware: Other than the A series, all other Slackware
  software series have been merged into single directories.  This has been done
  to accomodate software packages larger will fit on a 1.44 megabyte floppy
  disk.  So, the Slackware A series can still be installed for floppy disks, but
  not the rest of it.  Sorry to those still generating 100+ installation
  floppies (are there any? :^) but fragmenting the distribution for 
  complete installation from floppy disks really isn't practical anymore.
  As part of this update, most of the tagfiles, index files (diskap1, diskd1,
  diske1, etc) and maketag/maketag.ez scripts were edited.
slakware/a1/aoutlibs.tgz: /usr/i486-linuxaout/ directory changed to the more
                          generic /usr/ix86-linuxaout/ structure used by the
                          Linux GCC team.

slakware/k1/linuxinc.tgz: Added redundant Linux 2.0.33 include files package.
slakware/n1/nn_nntp.tgz: Name changed from nn-nntp.tgz, since dashes are not
                         legal on ISO9660 filesystems, and Slackware package
                         names (at least within the /slakware area) follow 
                         this standard.  Package recompiled.
slakware/n1/nn_spool.tgz: Name changed from nn-spool.tgz.  Missing manual pages
                          added.  Package recompiled.

----------------------------
Wed Mar 18 16:52:55 CST 1998
slakware/a8/shadow.tgz: If /var/log/sulog doesn't exist, make it with mode 640.
                        This prevents lusers from trying to make it mode 666,
                        and covering their tracks after attempting to guess
                        your root password. (which, if it's any good, should be
                        a pointless waste of time anyway)

                         rewindstdin, and patched SETUP to use them.  This

                         have an installed C compiler.

                          (/var/spool/mail/root.new) about setting up a Linux
                          printer using APSfilter.
slakware/n3/diskn3: edited.
slakware/n3/ppp.tgz: Added ppp-2.3.3 in addition to ppp-2.2.0f.  (Using ppp-2.3
                     requires a kernel that supports it)  Also upgraded pppsetup
                     to version 1.98.

                          /usr/include and /usr/lib to allow ncurses to be
                          picked up by auto-configure scripts as the default
                          curses library.

                        alias net-pf-5 off

                      libcurses.so and libcurses.a in /usr/lib/oldcurses.  
                      These new locations should keep automated configure
                      scripts from spotting these and using them, when they'd
                      probably be better off using ncurses.
slakware/n4/tin.tgz: Recompiled to use ncurses.
slakware/n6/tcpip.tgz: Removed obsolete /etc/named.boot, added default
                       "news.my_news_server.com" in /etc/nntpserver (gives a
                       little better idea of what goes in there :^), fixed some
                       other typos in comments, upgraded to nfs-server-beta31.

                     kernel in more places, and to not try to put the whole
                     contents of /boot on the floppy, since some people use
                     this as an old kernel repository.

                          to prevent a syslog entry (and disk access) for each

contrib/bsdlpr.tgz: A port of BSD lpr-5.9, with security problems fixed.

        NOTE: A *lot* of people out there have been reporting problems with
        LPRng (the default print spooler in Slackware 3.2), that it doesn't 
        like their printcap, or text prints out with stair-stepping, or that
        it just plain isn't working.  While most of these problems are caused
        by incorrect network configuration or other configuration errors (LPRng
        works fine for me), it's clear that the old BSD lpr (used in earlier
        Slackware releases) wasn't as picky about things and was easier to get
        working, in general.  So, now that the security holes in BSD lpr are 
        supposed to be fixed, I'm providing it here as a replacement package.
        Considering the number of complaints regarding LPRng, BSD lpr may
        become the default print spooler again when the next Slackware release
        comes around. :^)
----------------------------
Tue Apr 29 17:19:17 CDT 1997
slakware/a1/devs.tgz: Fixed major numbers for: pcaudio pcmixer pcsp pcsp16
slakware/a3/getty.tgz: Fixed /usr/doc/getty_ps/Examples directory permissions.
slakware/e8/emacsbin.tgz: Fixed /usr/doc/emacs-19.31 directory.
slakware/n5/tcpip.tgz: YP clients upgraded to version 2.2-970318.
slakware/x1/diskx1: edited.
slakware/x1/xlock.tgz: Upgraded to version 4.02.  IMPORTANT:  Everyone with
                       xlock installed on a Slackware 3.2 machine should
                       install the new xlock package immediately -- a major
                       security hole exists in the previous version that allows
                       anyone on your machine to become root!
slakware/x6/x32cfg.tgz: Added new xlock modes to system.fvwmrc.
slakware/x7/x32bin.tgz: SuperProbe chmoded 711.
slakware/xap3/fvwm95.tgz: Added new xlock modes to system.fvwm2rc95.

slakware/n5/tcpip.tgz: ttysnoop patched to work with shadow passwords.
----------------------------
Sun Apr 20 15:33:47 CDT 1997
slakware/a7/sysvinit.tgz:  Starting of /usr/sbin/crond in /etc/rc.d/rc.M moved
                           to after the network initialization, in case /usr is
                           being mounted via NFS.
----------------------------
Thu Apr 17 19:01:18 CDT 1997
slakware/n5/tcpip.tgz:  'talk' was formatting text on the screen incorrectly; 
                        recompiling with -I/usr/include/ncurses fixed it.
----------------------------
Thu Apr 17 12:26:37 CDT 1997
slakware/a8/shadow.tgz:  YAAD (Yet Another adduser Adjustment :), the script
                         was not adding a user shell in /etc/passwd unless one
                         was specified.  This resulted in users who could log
                         in just fine, but couldn't change their default
                         shell.
----------------------------
Wed Apr 16 13:58:55 CDT 1997
slakware/a8/shadow.tgz:  Another adjustment to /usr/bin/adduser -- this time
                         merely cosmetic.  A bad -z test in the script caused
                         an error message on the screen, but didn't affect the
                         script's function.
----------------------------
Mon Apr 14 12:34:28 CDT 1997
slakware/a8/shadow.tgz:  Bug in /usr/sbin/adduser fixed -- new users were being
                         placed in the 'bin' group instead of 'users'.
----------------------------
Sat Apr 12 14:42:02 CDT 1997

----------------------------
Wed Apr  9 15:09:23 CDT 1997
slakware/a7/sysvinit.tgz: Starting of kerneld moved back where it was.  Seems
                          kerneld might be needed to mount certain types of
                          filesystems. :^)
----------------------------
Mon Apr  7 23:33:07 CDT 1997
slakware/a7/sysvinit.tgz: Starting of kerneld moved further down in 
                          /etc/rc.d/rc.S, after the filesystems have been
                          checked and mounted.
----------------------------
Mon Apr  7 23:12:37 CDT 1997
slakware/a8/shadow.tgz: Improved /usr/sbin/adduser script added, 
                        old one moved to /usr/sbin/adduser2.

Mon Mar 31 14:19:22 CST 1997
slakware/a1/bash.tgz:  Downgraded from bash-2.0 to bash-1.14.7.  Seems a lot
                       of people are encountering funny problems with scripts
                       using bash-2.0, so I'm replacing it with the earlier
                       stable version.  If you want to use bash 2.0 anyway,
                       there will be a bash-2.0.tgz package in the contrib/
                       directory.

slakware/n4/sendmail.tgz: Upgraded to version 8.8.2.  If you're using the
                          previous sendmail package, please install this one
                          instead.  Sendmail 8.8.0 has a serious security hole.

slakware/a5/sysvinit.tgz: Moved PCMCIA init in rc.S back where it was, since
                          the new location caused some problems since /var isn't
                          read-write at that point.  Anyway, it appears that 
                          there's really not a good reason to have the PCMCIA 
                          init that early -- those devices really shouldn't be
                          in the /etc/fstab, but added by options in the scripts
                          found in /etc/pcmcia.
----------------------------

slakware/n6/apache.tgz:  Moved init file to /etc/rc.d.
slakware/a5/sysvinit.tgz: Added rc.httpd to rc.M.
                          Added kerneld init to rc.S.
                          Moved PCMCIA init earlier in rc.S, before drive
                          checking.
                          Changed default permissions on rc.cdrom, since most
                          people (including myself :^) really don't like that
                          startup script.
bootdsks.12/: All 1.2 MB bootdisks replaced.  I was finally able to reproduce
              the problems people have reported with these disks, and tracked
              it down to a bad BIOS in the machine used to generate the disks.
              The old versions seemed only to boot on a few select machines 
              (like, unfortunately the ones used for testing) but these should
              work in more machines.  If you still run into problems, check
              these things:  1>  Is the floppy cable hooked up right?
                             2>  Is DOS formatting the disks to the right
                                 capacity?  Sometimes it'll try to do 1.44 MB.
                                 If that happens to you, you could try using the
                                 1.44 MB boot images.
                             3>  Is the floppy drive order switched in BIOS?
                                 This doesn't seem to work for LILO/Linux.

slakware/ap5/texinfo.tgz: Upgraded to version 3.7, moved texinfo.tex into
        /usr/lib/teTeX/texmf/tex/texinfo for compatability with the newly 
        added teTeX distribution.
slakware/ap5/diskap5: edited.
slakware/t{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}: REPLACED, with directories containing a new TeX
        system based on Thomas Esser's teTeX distribution (version 0.4), with 
        xfig and transfig added.  To upgrade an existing Slackware system to use
        the new version of TeX, follow these simple instructions:
          1. Remove the old TeX distribution:
               cd /var/log/packages
               removepkg nt?-*
          2. Remove the old /usr/lib/texmf directory tree:
               cd /usr/lib
               rm -r texmf
          3. Clean out any old temporary fonts:
               cd /var/texfonts
               rm -r *
          4. Install the new teTeX distribution.  Either 
             install all the packages with installpkg:
               installpkg t?/*.tgz
             Or, use setup to reinstall the new T series.
          5. Log out, and then back in.  This will add
             /usr/lib/teTeX/bin to your $PATH.  Then, you
             can run texconfig to set your local preferences.

Slackware96 (v. 3.1.0) is released.  New features include the 2.0.0 Linux
kernel, gcc-2.7.2, and the 5.3.12 C library.  Lots of packages were upgraded
to work correctly with the new kernel.
