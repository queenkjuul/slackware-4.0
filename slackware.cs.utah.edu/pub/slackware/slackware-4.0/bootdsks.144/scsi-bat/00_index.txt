  Slackware SCSI bootdisks
  ------------------------

  This directory contains a collection of batch files used to create Slackware
  bootdisks.  To create a disk, just put a formatted floppy disk in your drive
  and choose one of the options listed below to make the disk.  Read all of the
  choices carefully to pick the disk that best matches the hardware in your
  machine.  NOTE:  Using the VIEW program to create the Slackware bootdisks
  may not work under Windows.  If you're running Windows95 or 98, you should
  restart your machine in MS-DOS mode before creating a bootdisk.

  NOTE:  In addition to some sort of SCSI support, all of these disks contain
         support for IDE hard drives and CDROM drives.  So, if you're running
         a mixed IDE/SCSI system, the kernels on these disks will be able to
         handle the situation just fine.  Look for the disk below containing
         support for your SCSI controller card.

                   Adaptec AHA-2920; and at least one IBM board).

gdt.bat            This is a bootdisk for all SCSI Disk Array Controllers
                   (EISA/ISA/PCI) manufactured by ICP Vortex.

ibmmca.bat         This is a bootdisk based on a development kernel which
                   supports MicroChannel Architecture, found in some IBM 
                   PS/2 machines and laptops. It is a bus system similar to
                   PCI or ISA.  Support for most MCA SCSI, Ethernet, and
                   Token Ring adapters is included.

in2000.bat         Always IN2000 SCSI support.

initio.bat         Supports the Initio 91XXU(W) and Initio 91XXU(W) SCSI
                   host adapters.

iomega.bat         IOMEGA parallel port SCSI support.  This supports
                   the parallel-port Zip drives as a Linux SCSI device.
                   This disk supports the older PPA parallel Zip drives
                   as well as the newer ZipPlus drives that use the IMM
                   driver.

megaraid.bat       This bootdisk supports the AMI MegaRAID 428 and 438
                   (and maybe 466) SCSI host adapters.

n53c4xx.bat        NCR 53c406a and Symbios Logic sym53c416 SCSI support.

n_5380.bat         NCR 5380 and 53c400 SCSI support.  This is the generic
                   NCR family of SCSI controllers, not to be confused with
                   the NCR 53c7 or 8xx controllers.  An example of a
                   controller that uses the NCR53c400 chip is the Trantor
                   T130B.

n_53c7xx.bat       NCR 53c7xx, 53c8xx SCSI support.  (Most NCR PCI
                   SCSI controllers use this driver, or the driver below)

n_53c8xx.bat       This is the FreeBSD NCR driver adapted to Linux for
                   the NCR53C8XX family of PCI-SCSI controllers. This
                   driver supports parity checking, tagged command queuing,
                   fast SCSI II transfer up to 10 MB/s with narrow SCSI
                   devices and 20 MB/s with wide scsi devices.  It also
                   supports Ultra SCSI data transfers with NCR53C860 and
                   NCR53C875 controllers.  The following Symbios/NCR 
                   chipsets are supported by the driver in this bootdisk:
                   810 810A 815 825 825A 860 875 876 895 896

no_kbd.bat         This version of scsi.s is a workaround for a problem:
                   Some newer P2/Celeron systems have been known to
                   reboot themselves as the kernel is starting up.  This
                   seems to happen as the keyboard LEDs are reset.  The
                   no_kbd.s does not reset the keyboard LEDs, and will
                   boot correctly on most machines with this symptom.
                   A BIOS upgrade from the motherboard manufacturer may
                   fix the problem.

no_pci.bat         If you're having problems with a hang during PCI
                   probing, try this SCSI-supporting bootdisk without PCI
                   BIOS support.  Some old PCI motherboards have BIOS
                   bugs and may crash if "PCI bios support" is enabled,
                   but they run fine without this option.  In many cases
                   the BIOS can be fixed with a flash update from the
                   motherboard manufacturer's web site.

old_cd.bat         This disk is provided in the unlikely event that
                   someone needs to install from an old CD-ROM drive on a
                   proprietary (*not* SCSI or IDE/ATAPI) interface to a
                   hard drive on a SCSI controller.  This disk supports
                   most Linux supported SCSI controllers, plus the CD-ROM
                   drives supported by these bootdisks:  aztech.i, cdu31a.i,
                   cdu535.i, cm206.i, goldstar.i, isp16.i, mcd.i, mcdx.i,
                   optics.i, sanyo.i, and sbpcd.i.
                       
pas16.bat          Pro Audio Spectrum/Studio 16 SCSI support.

pci2000.bat        This bootdisk supports the PCI2000I, PCI2220i, and 
                   PSI240i EIDE interface cards.  All of these act as
                   SCSI host adapters.

qlog_fas.bat       ISA/VLB/PCMCIA Qlogic FastSCSI! support.  (also 
                   supports the Control Concepts SCSI cards based on the
                   Qlogic FASXXX chip)

qlog_isp.bat       Supports all Qlogic PCI SCSI controllers, except the
                   PCI-basic, which is supported by the AMD SCSI driver
                   found on the am53c974.s bootdisk.

scsi.bat           A generic SCSI bootdisk, with support for most SCSI
                   controllers that work under Linux.  (NOTE: This disk
                   wastes a lot of memory, since it contains nearly *all*
                   of the SCSI drivers.  If you know which SCSI controller
                   your system has, it's *far* better to use the disk 
                   designed especially for it.  But, if you don't know,
                   then this generic disk might just work for you.)

scsinet.bat        Supports most SCSI controllers, plus many of the most
                   common ethernet cards.  Use this for installing over a
                   network to a SCSI drive.  (Or you can also use the
                   bootdisk for your SCSI controller plus the appropriate
                   ethernet module.  See the README files in the ../modules
                   directory if you want to try this approach)
                   NOTE:  Don't be too surprised if scsinet.s causes your
                   machine to hang.  It's loaded with nearly every SCSI
                   and network driver for Linux, and unless your hardware
                   is well behaved, the probing process can freeze your
                   machine.  If that happens, don't panic, just use a
                   disk with less drivers.  If you're not installing over
                   the network, the disk designed for your SCSI controller
                   is the right choice.  If you need network support, use
                   the disk designed for your SCSI card, plus put 'insmod'
                   and the required network modules on another floppy to
                   load before running setup.  The README files in the
                   ../modules directory explain this process in detail.

seagate.bat        Seagate ST01/ST02, Future Domain TMC-885/950 SCSI
                   support.

sgivis.bat         This bootdisk supports the SGI Visual Workstation
                   models 320 and 540.  The kernel also supports Adaptec
                   aic7xxx SCSI cards, multiple CPUs, and the SGI DBE 
                   video frame buffer graphics console.

smp.bat            This disk is the same as the generic scsi.s bootdisk,
                   but adds support for motherboards with multiple CPUs.
                   (symmetric multiprocessing, or SMP)

sym538xx.bat       This bootdisk contains enhanced support for Symbios/NCR
                   SCSI chipsets in the SYM53C8XX family.  It drops support
                   of some of the oldest chipsets in this family in order
                   to use some new features, so older cards will need to
                   use the n_53c7xx.s or n_53c8xx.s bootdisk images instead.
                   The driver in this bootdisk supports the following
                   Symbios/NCR chipsets: 810A 825A 860 875 876 895 896

tekram.bat         This bootdisk supports the Tekram DC390(T) PCI SCSI
                   Hostadapter with the Am53C974A chip, and perhaps other
                   cards using the same chip.  It does _not_ support the
                   DC390W/U/F adaptor with the NCR/Symbios chips -- for
                   those cards, use the n_53c8xx.s bootdisk.

trantor.bat        Trantor T128/T128F/T228 SCSI support.

ultrastr.bat       UltraStor 14F, 24F, and 34F SCSI support.

ustor14f.bat       UltraStor 14F and 34F SCSI support.
