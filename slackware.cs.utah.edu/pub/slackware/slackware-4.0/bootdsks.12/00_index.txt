 1.2 MB LINUX BOOTDISKS

 To install Linux, you'll need a bootdisk and a rootdisk.  The bootdisk
 has to contain drivers that support your hardware, so you'll have to select
 the most appropriate disk for your system.  NOTE: it's best to use the
 disk with the least drivers possible to save memory.

README.TXT      This file contains information about the drivers in the
                various bootdisks, and instructions for using a bootdisk to
                start a system that isn't booting properly.

README.SCSI     Information about using a SCSI controller with Slackware.

WHICH.ONE       A chart to help you select which bootdisk to use.

ide-bat/        If your system does not have a SCSI controller, you'll want
                to use one of the IDE Slackware bootdisks.  To create one of
                these, select this option to switch into the ide-bat directory
                and choose a disk from the list.

scsi-bat/       If your system has a SCSI controller, you'll need to use one
                of the SCSI Slackware bootdisks.  To create one of these, use
                this option to switch into the scsi-bat directory and then
                choose a disk from the list.

  NOTE: The RAWRITE utility used to create the boot and root floppies may not
        work under Windows95 and 98, so if you're running Windows you should
        restart your machine in MS-DOS mode before creating the disks.
