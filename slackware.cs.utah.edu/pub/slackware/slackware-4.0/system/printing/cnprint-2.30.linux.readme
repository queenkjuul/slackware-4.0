0. What Is CNPRINT and What's New

CNPRINT, a utility to print Chinese text (or convert to PostScript) under 
	DOS, VMS and UNIX systems.  It works just as a print command on 
	your system.  Currently GB, Hz and BIG-5 formats are supported. 

These versions are updated from V2.20/V2.21.  New/improved features are 
indicated by *.  Thanks to users for your valuable support and suggestions.

Main changes:
1. customized default settings in "cnprint.cmd", such as char size, margins,
   character and line spaces, etc.
2. specify the space between columns.
3. created 4 modes for landscape printing l1, l2, l3 and l4, good for printing
   HXWZ, save paper.  See V.(5) for details.
4. auto-detection of Big-5 file.
5. page-select options, possible to print only selected pages.
6. specify the PS print command on command line (Note: all "PS print command"
   in this document refers to "PS print device port" if your system is DOS).
7. HBF environmental variable is changed to HBFPATH (this will also be used
   by other softwares).
8. fixed some bugs.

Version 2.30 is for UNIX and VMS, Version 2.31 is for DOS.

I. Functions and Features

	1. Print GB/Hz/BIG-5 format Chinese text (or pure English text) 
	   or convert them to PostScript. (a, b)
    *	2. Hz to GB or GB to Hz conversions. (c).
	3. Small disk space requirement; PS file < 400K per issue of HXWZ.  
	4. Support HBF, work with almost all bitmap font files with any
	   sizes.
	5. Change font (character size) for a whole document, set font 
	   (character size) for a group of characters.
	6. Multicolumn for a page or part of a page.
	7. "Intelligent" treatment of punctuation marks.
	8. Set gray level for a whole document or a group of characters.
	9. Page numbering, change of margins.
       10. Set paper orientation: Portrait or Landscape.
       11. Vertical printing mode.
       12. Change line space and character space and width of English chars.
       13. Change English font.
       14. Multiple copies of print-out.
    *  15. User defined default values for margins, character size, etc.
    *  16. Start a new page at any point (@[P#]).
       17. Friendly designed so that even if you make a mistake the program 
	   would take care for you in most cases.

(a). SPEED of printing depends on printer and the number of characters in 
a page (from 3-4 pages per minute to 1.5 minutes per page).  The fastest 
reported so far is 135 seconds for one issue of HXWZ.  

(b). If one page, the PS file conforms to the Encapsulated PostScript file 
format EPSF 3.0 and can be included in other documents (such as a Microsoft 
Word document).  See part V for details.

(c). Simple Hz<->GB conversion for standard Hz/GB file.  For files that might
contain bugs, F. F. Lee's hz2gb is suggested. 

II. What Do You Need to Use CNPRINT
	A machine runing UNIX or VMS (V2.30), or an (IBM compatible) PC 
	    running DOS (V2.31)
	A PostScript printer (CAUTION: NOT ordinary laser printer)
	CNPRINT V?.??
	One or more Chinese (HBF) font file(s) (see part VI)

III. Where to Get CNPRINT
	site: ifcss.org
	directory: /software/unix/print (cnprint230.c, cnprint230.readme)
		   /software/vms/print (cnprint230.exe, VMS only)
		   /software/dos/print (cnprint.doc, cnprint.exe, DOS only)
		   /software/fonts  (fonts)
		   /software/fonts/HBF  (HBF files)
Note: 1. The /pub/software directory at cnd.org is a mirror of the /software
	directory at ifcss.org.  You may also get the above files at cnd.org.
      2. (UNIX only) There is a man file at /software/unix/man (compiled by 
	Nelson Chin, butta1@cs.bu.EDU).
      3. Get the following files according to your system (read part VI before
	you get any font or HBF file).
	VMS:	cnprint230.readme, cnprint230.exe, fonts, HBF files
	UNIX:	cnprint230.readme, cnprint230.c, fonts, HBF files
	DOS:	cnprint.doc, cnprint.exe, fonts, HBF files

IV. First Thing to Do

     1. There is a data file enclosed as Appendix C.  Please cut and save it 
	as "cnprint.cmd" in the same directory where the fonts are kept (Note
	CNPRINT can work without "cnprint.cmd", but some functions are lost).
	In "cnprint.cmd", you need to 

	a. Specify the PS print command (device port) on your system. 
	(DOS only:  the device port for printing PostScript files is most 
	likely to be one of LPT1, LPT2, COM2, COM1.  Put "LPT2:" if it is 
	LPT2.  Ask a local expert for help)

	WARNING: The print command (port) MUST be the command for printing
		PostScript documents.  If you are NOT sure, please DO ask your
		system manager, otherwise it could cause BIG problems. 

	If you do not specify the print command (port), CNPRINT would still 
	generate PostScript file(s) but would not print it, you can then print
	it by sending it to a PS printer. 		

	b. Specify the default Big-5 font (HBF) file name in "cnprint.cmd" 
	if you are going to print Big-5 documents. 

	c. If you are a user outside US, you may need to change the paper
	size in "cnprint.cmd".  The default is A (8.5x11 inch).  For example,
	if you use A4, you should change them to 8.27 and 11.69 respectively
	(see Appendix A for paper sizes). 

     2. Specify the full path (directory) for the font files (NOT required,
	but highly recommended).  If you do not specify the full path, you 
	need to run CNPRINT under the directory you store the bitmap font 
	file, HBF files and cnprint.cmd (they are assumed to be in the same 
	directory).

	DOS: add a line in the "autoexec.bat" file: 

	        HBFPATH=C:\FONT\  (if fonts is kept under dircetory C:\FONT)

	UNIX: use either a) or b) below (if you used both, b) has priority):

	    a). set an environment variable HBFPATH (put it in your .cshrc file)

		setenv HBFPATH "~/your_subdir_for_fonts/"

	    b). change line 28 of the source file and put your path there 

		#define CNLIB "<path>cnj24.hbf"
 
	VMS: You are recommended to follow steps in 4, although method b)
	    for UNIX also works.

	(NOTE: Other softwares may allow HBFPATH points to several paths, but
	    currently CNPRINT only uses the first one)

     3. (UNIX and VMS only) Compile the source program (there is no need to 
	re-compile after making changes in "cnprint.cmd").  

	UNIX:	cc cnprint.c -o cnprint

	    if this did not work, ask a local expert or your system manager.

	VMS: get "cnprint230.exe" directly.  If that did not work, you can
	    get cnprint.c and compile:

		cc cnprint
		link cnprint
		del cnprint.obj;*

	If this did not work, ask your system manager for help on how to
	compile a C program.  CNPRINT may not work on old versions of VMS.
	If you are using old versions of VMS, ask your system manager to 
	update it.

     4.	(VMS only) You need to create a login file under your main directory
	(or modify it if already exists).  The file name is "login.com" and
	put two lines similar to the following in it:

	$cnprint :=="$mvsd:[cai.gb]cnprint.exe"
	$HBFPATH :=="mvsd:[cai.gb.font]"

	here "mvsd" is my disk name; "[cai.gb]" and "[cai.gb.font]" are my
	directories containing "cnprint.exe" and fonts respectively.  You 
	should change them accordingly.  If this did not work, ask your
	system manager for help on how to setup these things.

V. USAGE  

	For normal usage:	cnprint filename 
	For help: 		cnprint 
        For extended usage:
		cnprint [-h] [-z]  ... [-l] [-f font] filename [PS(GB)name]

	-h:	Help message
     *	-5(-55): Input is Big-5 file (12)
     *	-z(-zz)(-zzz): Hz to GB conversion only (4)
	-w:	Convert GB/Hz to PS without printing (4)
	-u:	Keep PS file after printing (4)
	-x2:	Set character width/height 1.2  (2)
	-y3:	Set character height/width 1.3  (2)
	-p4:	Print/convert 4 pages at a time (8)
     *	-c3(-c320): Divide one page into 3 columns (-c320, optionally specify 
		the space between columns as 20 points, 1 point = 1/72 inch) 
	-f font: Select font (2)
     *	-l(-l3): Set paper orientation Landscape (5)
     *	-j:	At the end of document, the printout does NOT go to the bottom
		of a page if multicolumn
	-v(-vv): Vertical printing (13)
	-s:	Suppress the effects of the functional sequences @[**] (6) 
	-t:	Do not print time and CNPRINT logo on the lower-left corner
	-m3(-m): Print 3 copies of the document (do NOT display menu if -m)
		(-m3m or -mm3 for both)
     *	-hz:	Input is a Hz file, CNPRINT would not ask for conformation (7)
     *	-a:	Print all CH alphabets and numbers as English ones (7)
		(Note the definition of -a is changed)
	-e56(-e): Set the width of English char 0.56 of that of Chinese char 
		(Output is an EPS file if -e) (-e56e or -ee56 for both) (10)
     *	-d:	Do -e5 and suppress the special treatment of punctuation 
		marks (11)
     *	-b3(e21): begin printing at page 3, and (optional) end printing at 
		page 21 (14)
     *	-o(-oo): print only odd-numbered or (-oo) even-numbered pages (14)
     *	-q=laserps (DOS, -q=lpt2:): specify the PS print command as "laserps",
		or in DOS, specify the PS print port name as "lpt2:" (15)

Note:   a. Most of the options can be combined.
	b. The order is not important except "filename" must appear before
	   "PS(GB)name" (but need not appear consecutively)
e.g.
	cnprint -w -x2be10 filename 
	cnprint -w -x2be10 filename PSname
	cnprint -x2be10 filename -w PSname
	cnprint -x2be10 filename -c2 PSname -q=laserps -o

1. To set margins, line space, character space and character size for   
	the WHOLE document, run CNPRINT and follow the menu instructions.
	You can also set your preferred values in cnprint.cmd.

2. To select font and character width-height ratio for the WHOLE document,
	use -f, -x -y options above.  The use of -f option is 
	
	-f k24	or -f cnk24.hbf for 24x24 Kaishu font
	-f f16	or -f cnf16.hbf for 16x16 Fanti font 
	(see Part VI for meaning of k24, f16, etc)

***Important*** It is recommended to set the font, line space, char space and 
	char width/height used for the WHOLE document or majority of the 
	document by -f, -x, -y or menu.  This would make the program much
	more efficient.  

3. To select font, character size, width-height ratio, line space, character 
	space and width of English character for part of the document
	(or a group of characters, even one character), or divide a page/part
	of a page into several columns, insert the sequence @[**] in the text.
	The meaning of **:
	
	@[f*] or @[F*]   select Chinese font, 16, 24, 48.  * is the font style 
			code, see d).
	@[v*] or @[V*]   select Chinese font, 40, 56, 64  (d)
	@[h1] or @[H2]   select English font, normal (upright)
	@[q3] or @[Q4]   select English font, italic/oblique (Xieti)
                         capital H/Q: Bold; number 0-9 for different font, 
			 see menu at run time.

	@[18]	Integer number for character size in points.  1 point=0.355mm
	@[X2]	Set character width/height 1.2
	@[Y3]	Set character height/width 1.3
	@[G2]	Set gray level 0.2, 0=black; 1=white
	@[C2]	Select columns, i.e. divide the text into two columns

	@[E7]	Set width of English character 0.7 of that of Chinese char
	@[Ix]   Set line space, x must be 0-9, a-f.  1-9 set the line space 
		0.1-0.9 of the standard value and a-f set it 1-6 times of 
		the standard value (standard value = 50% of char size) 
	@[Ax]	Set character space, x must be 0-9, a-f.  1-f set the char
		space 1-15 times of the standard value (standard value = 8% of 
		char size)

    *	@[MVxxxyyy] Move current point to (xxx, yyy), allow you put text
		anywhere on the page.  xxx, yyy are in points (1inch = 72pts)
		and are relative to the upper-left corner of the text.  If 
		(3, 25), put @[MV003025] instead of @[MV325] or @[MV 3 25].  
		If xxx (or yyy) equals 001, then do NOT change x (y) position.
		This is not designed to work with multicolumn at this stage 
		so it may affect the column formatting.
    *   @[P2]   If the current position is within 2 lines of the end of page,
		start a new page.  If @[P0], start a new page immediately.
		If used with multicolumn option, this command may produce 
		effects some people don't like (while others may like).

     a. All the above letters, except fvhq, must be in upper case; 0 or 00 would
	select the default value except in @[f*] or @[F*]. 

     b. Each of the above sequence would takes effect immediately and stop
	only after the same nature of selection is choosed again.  For example,
	if you select a character size 12 by @[12], it would remain 12 points
	until you select another size, say 15 by @[15].  

     c. Column marker must begin at the beginning of a paragraph and must end 
	at the end of a paragraph right after the hard return (i.e. the
	beginning of next line, even if it is a blank line).

     d. To select font, you must specify font style by j, f, n, k, h, ...
	or J, F, N, K, H, ... in the place of * in f* or F*.  The meaning of 
	j, f... is j/J for Jianti, f/F for Fanti, etc (this is actually set 
	by yourself, see the FONT part).  The font size are small (16x16), 
	middle (24x24) and large (48x48).  To specify small size font, both
	f* must be in lower case; to specify middle size font, one and only
	one of f* or F* should be in lower case, the other in upper case.  
	For example, @[fH] or @[Fh] both select 24x24 Heiti font, and @[ff] 
	select 16x16 Fanti font.  Similar rules apply to 40x40, 56x56 and 
	64x64 fonts (use v*, V* to select).

    ***	The metric information about English font is obtained from HP printers
	and may NOT apply to other printers.  Besides, only printable 
	characters are included.

     e. The program will use whatever character size, width/height ratio
	right before the column maker @[C#] setting the parameters for the 
	columns, so it is best to select the character size and width/height
	ratio for most of the multicolumn portion right before the column
	marker @[C#].
 
4. If -w is selected, CNPRINT would generate a PS file but would not send
	it to the printer.  -u would preserve the PS file after printing.  If
	a PS file name is given, the PS file would be kept even if -u is not
	selected.  The optional PS/GB name is taken as PS file name unless 
	-z(z)(z) is selected.  (The next release will not support -u)
    -zz:  GB -> Hz only; 
    -zzz: GB/Big-5 -> GB/Big-5, filter out the functional sequences @[**].

5. If you use -l to change paper orientation to Landscape, the default
	character size is 12.2 pts (if width/height=1), and the page will be 
	divided into 2 columns (to make it one column, use -lc1; -c1l would 
	not work).
   -l1, -l2, -l3, -l4:  select one of the sepecial landscape modes, the 
	settings in "cnprint.cmd" will be suppressed.  These modes are 
	designed for printing HXWZ (l1, l2) or LYTX (l3, l4).
	
6. Option -s would suppress the effect of the functional sequence @[**] and
	would not print it.  But if you want it printed, use -s# (# is any
	single digit number and # > 2). 

7. If you use -hz to tell CNPRINT that the input is a Hz file, CNPRINT would 
	not ask for conformation.  But this is only optioanl for Hz file.
     Notice that in previous versions this is done with -a.  Now -a has
	new definitions, i.e. to change CH alphebits and numbers to English
	ones.  This function was default in previous versions.  The reason
	to make it optional is to keep the original style of text.
     -aa: Input is a pure English text (some settings to make it look nice).

8. If you do not have enough disk space (this is less likely to happen because
	the PS file generated by CNPRINT is quite small), try -p# option.

9. You MAY not need to wait until the print job finishes to press RETURN.  In
	most machines, you can hit return after the print job is STARTed (not
	just put on the queue). You can test this with a small file. 

10. Default is -e5, i.e., the width of English char half of that of a Chinese
	char.  But since CNPRINT still adjust the puctuations in this case, 
	the print out may not be the same as you expected.  Try -d (see 11) 
	if you need the text to line up.
    If -e, the PS file conforms to EPSF-3.0 standard and can be included in 
	other document such as Microsoft Word on PC (which I tested, may not 
	work on others).  You can NOT display/preview it properly, but the 
	final print-out is OK.  Use -we option to generate the PS file and 
	name the PS file as *.eps.  Be sure to transfer the PS file as a TEXT
	file but open it as an "eps" file.  You may want to adjust the 
	BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury at line 4 in the PS file.  llx and lly 
	are the x and y coordinates of the lower left corner, urx and ury are
	the x and y coordinates of the upper right corner (relative to lower-
	left corner of the paper).  The unit is points (1 inch = 72 points) 
	and the numbers must be integer.
    -e can also used to specify the page number to end printing, see (14).

11. In this case, the output would be the SAME as what you see on the screen
	when you edit the text IF you adjusted the number of characters in 
	a line properly.  Also, you should select Courier (the default) for 
	English font if you want the text to line up.  CNPRINT would not 
	adjust the punctuation marks in this case.  For example, a comma (,)
	may appear on the left end of a line.
    Note, some popular Chinese editors treat TABs differently, but I believe 
	the way CNPRINT does is the correct way.

12. For Big-5 documents, adjustment of puctunation marks is disabled.  If you 
	did not specify the default big-5 HBF file in "cnprint.cmd", you need
	to specify font with -f option.  If -5 is selected twice (by -55 or 
	-5 -5), some horizontal punctuations would be printed as their 
	vertical counterparts in vertical mode and vice versa.  Although 
	CNPRINT can detect Big-5 files automatically, it may fail in some 
	extreme cases, so it is best to supply -5.
    Note -e5 (-e55) is NOT interpreted as -e and -5 (-55), use -5e (-55e)
	in this case.
    
13. In vertical mode, adjustment of puctunation mark is disabled.  If document
	is GB/Hz, selected symbol characters are rotated to make them appear 
	better, and (if -v is selected twice by -vv or -v -v) some ASCII 
	punctuations would be printed as their Chinese counterparts.  In both
	GB and Big-5, if -v is selected twice, some punctuations are replaced
	with better looking ones.
    
14. These page numbers are the actual numbers that appear on the print-out, 
	please make sure they do not conflict with the starting page number.
		-b3e or -b3:	page 3 to end
		-b3e8:  	page 3 to page 8
		-be21:  	beginning to page 21
		-b3e20o:  	odd-numbered pages between 3 to 20
    Note any -e option immeadiately following the -b option is considered to 
	specify end-printing page number.  If the -e option is before the -b 
	option or there are other options after -b but before -e, the -e
	option is considered to be those defined in (10) above.	 

15. This would disable the PS print command (DOS: port name) in "cnprint.cmd".
	Another way to enter the PS print command (port name) is to select -w
	option on command line, then select P and answer YES in the menu.

16. Default Setting
	Input:		GB or Hz
	Font:		Jianti 24x24 (cnj24.hbf)
	Character Size:	14.5 pts (if width/height=1)  
	Character Width/Height:	1.0
	Paper Orientation: Portrait
	Line Orientation:  Horizontal
 
VI. FONT FILES

	Please finish reading this part before using CNPRINT.  Skip it only 
if you have used CNPRINT V2.20/V2.21 before.

	You need at least ONE font to run CNPRINT, and CNPRINT can use almost
any HBF font.  If you do not have enough space, I suggest you get only one of 
the following fonts.  The font-list below is only for the convenience of new 
users.  For full list please see the README file under /software/fonts/HBF 
directory.  All HBF files for bitmap font files with different style and size
(both GB and Big-5) are stored in that directory.  Please read the README file
under that directory before you get any bitmap font file or HBF file, and make
sure the HBF file and the bitmap font file(s) match.

		(Bitmap font files)		(HBF files)
	GB:	cclib.j24 (Jianti)		ccs24.hbf
		cclib.f24 (Fanti) 		ccs24f.hbf
	Big-5:  kcchin24.f00 (Fanti)		kcm24.hbf

   NOTE: a). Get all bitmap font files in BINARY mode, HBF files in ASCII mode. 

	 b). The bitmap font files, HBF files and "cnprint.cmd" should be put 
	under the same directory.

	 c). An HBF font consists of one or more existing bitmap files and 
	one HBF file (See article about HBF carried on HXWZ #128, CM9309B).
	You need to get both the bitmap files and the HBF files in order to
	use CNPRINT.  CNPRINT requires (*) the name of the HBF file to be in 
	the following format:

	cn*##.hbf

	where * can be any letter (a-z, use lower case if your system is 
	case-sensitive, like unix) and ## be the number reflecting the size 
	of the font, e.g. 24 for 24x24.  It is suggested that you make the 
	letters meaningful, for example, 'k' for Kaishu, 'f' for Fanti.
	* However, you can select an HBF file with ANY name on command line:
		cnprint -f my_own.hbf filename ...

	 d). After you get the HBF file, you NEED to rename them.  For example: 

		ccs24.hbf --> cnj24.hbf
                -----------------------

	For some non-square bitmap fonts, like kcchin16.f00, the HBF file is
	named as kcm14.hbf, it is better to rename it as cnm16.hbf (i.e. use
	numbers 16, 24, 48, 40, 56, 64).  If you name it as cnm14.hbf, you can
	select it on command line with "-f m14", but you could not select it 
	with @[f*].  Since CNPRINT gets the size information from the HBF file,
	it is able to use fonts with any size.  For example, if you have a 
	32x32 font and you name the HBF file as cnx56.hbf, it is still OK. 

	You can also write your own HBF file according to the HBF standard.  
	Note CNPRINT only uses the simple properties.

VII. Known Problems 

     1. Q: The characters look alright but are not what it meant to be, or
	   are distorted, shifted up/down, left/right.
	A1: Check HBF file, make sure it matches the bitmap font file.  If 
	   you write you own HBF file, make sure the offset information is
	   correct.
	A2: The bitmap font is distorted in transmission.  Try to get it again,
	   using BINARY mode and transmit properly.
	A3: You are printing a Big-5 file with GB fonts.

     2. Q: CNPRINT failed to print, but I saw the printer was processing 
	   the job.
	A: It may be due to small memory on printer.  Try -n # option with 
	   smaller number (# = 1000 or less, default 2048) and contact author.  

     3. Q: CNPRINT only printed the first page.
	A: It may be due to the way your printer is connected to the computer,
	   or the printer setup.  You can get around by using -p1 option, i.e. 
	   print one page at a time (it helps if you also use -n 200 with -p1 
	   if the document is large).

     4. (VMS and UNIX only) Some machines do not support the time functions,
	then CNPRINT may stop running after displaying "*** Page 1 has been 
	done ***".  In this is the case, you should change line 26 of cnprint.c 
	from "#define  TIME 1" to "#define  TIME 0".  Or delete the lines
	containing those unsupported functions. 	
	Some machines do not support function "remove()", just delete it.

     5. Q: (DOS) When I typed "cnprint ...", the computer hung up.
	   (VMS) When I typed "cnprint ...", strange messages were displayed
		on the screen.

 	A1: Did you get cnprint.exe or cnprint230.exe in BINARY mode ?
	A2: (VMS) Did you follow the steps in IV (4) ?

     6. (DOS) Q: The message "Not enough memory" was displayed at some stage.
	A: Disconnect network and other things and try CNPRINT again.  You 
	   may want to generate PS file only (use -w option) if your printer
	   is connected via network.

     7. (Big-5 only) Q: Some non-frequently used characters are not printed
	   correctly, but the frequently used chars or symbols are OK.
	A: It is due to different versions of Big-5.  Try to match the 
	   font and the text, or use a conversion program, such as et2hku.

IX. Acknowledgement

	Thanks to numerous users of previous versions for valuble suggestions
	and encouragements, which make the continuous improvement of CNPRINT
	possible.  In particular, I would like to mention Nelson Chin (butta1
	@cs.bu.EDU), for both his suggestions and testing of V2.30 on his 
	systems.  Some of the initial ideas came from the GB2PS Version 1.00 
	of Dr. Wei Sun at william@anucsd.anu.edu.au.
