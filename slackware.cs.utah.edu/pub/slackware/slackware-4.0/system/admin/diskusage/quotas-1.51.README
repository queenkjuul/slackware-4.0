quotas-1.51-tar.gz is the latest release of quotas for linux.  The home site
is ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/subsystems/quota/all.tar.gz,
and this will compile just fine (at least on 1.3.x systems) after you copy
its mntent.h over /usr/include/mntent.h

Please note:  I don't maintain this or anything, I'm just uploading it since
people might need it ;-).
