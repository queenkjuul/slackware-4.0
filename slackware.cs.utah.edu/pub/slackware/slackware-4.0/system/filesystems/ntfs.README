This is a read-only driver for the Windows NT file system, or NTFS.
Read the file INSTALL on how to compile the driver and supporting tools.
Make sure you understand that this is alpha software. This means that the
implementation is neither complete nor well-tested. Still, it works for me
and others, so you can try it out. You should know how to restore the system
after a crash, and have a backup of any valuable data, just in case.
