Comment:
	With this is a patch against a clean dosemu-0.60.4
	it is possible to run PM make/compiler combinations.
	I tried it with DJ200 make on a dir with 15 obj-files, and it works fine
	(maybe Borland's protected mode make/compiler will work as well).

Usage:
	cd where_dosemu_src_is/dosemu
	zcat patch-0.60.4.dpmi.gz | patch -p0
	make 

Good luck!
