These are patches against PP 6.0.

As with my ISODE patches much of this is to do with building a shared
library consisting of libpp.a. This is not elegant but probably
requires less twiddling during building than the shared libisode.a.
The memory space used by this shared library is the top half of that
registered for ISODE. I should perhaps split it and register the
PP half seperately.

  There are also some fixes in here to avoid doing stupid things like
freeing malloced memory multiple times, trying to fclose(NULL) etc.

  Note that I am not in a position to test the X.400 channels in any
real way however the utility channels and SMTP appear fully working.
Offers of sponsorship are welcome :-).

  As with the ISODE stuff precompiled binaries should be in the same
place you found this. If you aren't using the Purple Distribution's
package manager you will need to read the .../PKG/map files in each
archive to figure out where things go. You *will* need to get the
documentation for PP if you expect to set it up at all. I won't upload
it myself but the archive maintainer may have put it in the same
directory as this. If not it can be found on src.doc.ic.ac.uk under
/packages/isode/pp among other places.
