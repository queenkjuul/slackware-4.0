Much of this is related to building a shared library which includes
libisode.a, libdsap.a and libftam.a. It isn't pretty. If you want to
build the shared library yourself expect to have to do a lot of
fiddling around. You will also need a *lot* of disk space :-).

  There are also general patches in here - notably to ensure the
timeouts for selects are reset correctly and to correct some rather
nasty carelessness in the logging code that could result in attempted
freeing of string literals.

  The 8.0.1 patches are included here. If you have already patched
you 8.0 source tree to 8.0.1 you might want to reverse them out first.
I don't think the 8.0.1 patches conflict with anything I did (they are
mostly to quipu) so you could probably just ignore the rejects...

  You will need the documentation for ISODE to set it up. I won't be
uploading it myself but the archive maintainer may have put it in the
same directory where you found this. If not it is on src.doc.ic.ac.uk
under /packages/isode among other places.

  You should find patches to PP 6.0 where you found this - along with
precompiled binaries. Note that the binaries are packaged for The Purple
Distribution of Linux. If you aren't using the Purple Distribution's
package manager you will have to read the .../PKG/map files in each
archive to find out where things should go.

  If ISODE/X.400/X.500 is of serious interest to you you might like to
consider donating hard disks/fast processors/T1 connections. I'm way
beyond the capabilities of my available resources here :-(.
