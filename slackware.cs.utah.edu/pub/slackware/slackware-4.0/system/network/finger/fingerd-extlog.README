fingerd-exlog.README

	This fingerd is modification of the NetBSD finger daemon version 8.
This daemon logs into syslog information about the people that were
fingered. It also allows you to block giving out "raw" information (i.e. it
would block finger -l @somesite.com). These attempts will be also logged.
