packages:

Recent changes to this list:
   		netkit-rusers-0.10 -> 0.11	(02-Aug-1997)


These may all be downloaded separately. If some or all of these have
been updated since this document was written, be sure to always get
the latest versions.

Please don't install packages you don't need; also please be sure to
remove any binaries of out-of-date versions of anything you choose not
to install.

(*) linux-ftpd hasn't ever really been part of NetKit and it isn't
packaged quite the same way as the others. This will probably change
in the future.
