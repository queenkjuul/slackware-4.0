INSTALLING COLLAGE
	Collage is available in executable form the anonymous ftp server
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.  New versions may be picked up from there.

	Platforms supported include:
	Sun Sparc (SunOS)
	IBM RS6000 (AIX)
	DEC DECstation (Ultrix)
	DEC Alpha (OSF/1)
	SGI (IRIX)
	HP 700 series (HP/UX)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

	You will need both the collage executable and the collage_server 
executable.  After downloading them by ftp in binary mode, move the collage 
and collage_server executable to a directory within your $PATH.  When you 
download the server executable, it will be under the name server.machinetype 
(Example server.sn4).  Since the collage_server is started up by collage, 
the server needs to be called something that collage can find it by.  
Rename the server to 'collage_server'.  Make sure that the executables are 
given execute permission after downloading.  This is done with the chmod 
command.  Ex  'chmod 755 collage server'

STARTING COLLAGE
        Collage is an X window based tool.   If you know how to
start up an X based tool, you can skip this section.  Also, if you
plan to run Collage on the same machine that your X server is running
on, you can skip this section.
        To start up an X window based tool, the user must first tell
the X server to allow clients from the machine your are running your
client on.  If your X display is a workstation, you can do this by
executing 'xhost +hostname'.  Where hostname is the name of the machine
that you will be running the X window tool on.
        On the client machine you need to specify where the X server
is running.  If your X server's name is 'yoyodyne' then you will type:

from csh:
        'setenv DISPLAY yoyodyne:0'
or from sh or ksh:
        'DISPLAY=yoyodyne:0'
        'export DISPLAY'

        See your local system administrator for details on running
X applications.

	Type 'collage'.  The collage main window should appear on your
X display and then a splash screen will appear for a couple seconds and
disappear while the tool is initializing.  If this does not happen,
check your X DISPLAY variable (above).

STARTING A COLLABORATIVE SESSION:

	A collaborative session is started by one person clicking
clicking on the main window menubar option 'Collaborate/Begin Session'.
This causes a dialog box to pop open allowing the user to type in a 
server DTM port.   A DTM port is of the format:

	[host]:port_number

Where host is the name of the machine of the DTM port and port_number
is some number between 2048 and 65535.  Pick some random number for
a port number and type it in so long as it is between 2k and 64k.
The host part is not necessary when the port is on the local machine.
This will always be the case when starting the server.

So type something in like 

	:2345

as your Server Port.

	People may join the collaborative session just started by selecting
'Collaborate/Join Session' on their collage main window.  They will need
to fill in the box that says 'Connect to server'.  In this box, they should
type the DTM port that was selected for the server.

Example:
	Bill and Ted want to collaborate.  They each start up collage by
typing 'collage'.  Bill is running this on a machine called 'yoyodyne'.
Bill selects 'Collaborate/Begin Session'.   In the "Server Port" box Bill 
types in ":2345".  Bill then selects 'OK' on the dialog box and the server
is launched and a dialog box pops up saying 'Just established a connection
with collab server'.
	On Ted's main window, he selects 'Collaborate/Join Session'.  In the
'Connect to Server' box, Ted types "yoyodyne:2345".  Ted then selects the
'OK' button and is connected up to the collab server.  If Ned wants to 
join the session, he does the same thing as Ted.

	From here on everything done is shared with all the other 
collaborators.


LOADING DATA OBJECTS:

        To load a single data set, click on the Load function located in
the File menu.  The tool opens up a motif file selection box.  The user
specifies the file that is to be loaded.  The user may select a file by first 
specifying the directory and then double clicking on the file.  If the file 
is an HDF file, the HDF browser window will open.  From the HDF browser the
user may select which data object is to be loaded.  The data object is
selected by double clicking on the desired HDF data object.  If multiple
objects are to be loaded the user may select them by first clicking on
the desired objects and then dragging or by holding the <CTRL> key
and clicking on the next object.  When all objects are selected, they
may be loaded by clicking on the "Send Selection" in the Transport menu.

SUPPORTED FILE TYPES:
	HDF
		RIS8 (raster images)
		SDS 2d & 3d (scientific data sets)
		PAL (palettes)
	GIF	Graphic Interchange Format
	XWD	X Window Dump
	ASCII text  

OPERATIONS:
        Once a data set is loaded, several data analysis operations
may be performed on it.  These include color histogram graphs,
XY profile plots, and color contour overlays.
	To produce a histogram, select the dashed square in the upper left
hand corner of the data set window.  This puts the cursor in region selection
mode.  Now select an area on the image that you wish to see a histogram of.
This is done by clicking the upper left hand corner of the rectangular region
and while the mouse button is held down dragging the mouse to the lower right
hand corner of the region.  When the mouse button is released a color histogram
plot will open up on each of the collaborators screen.  The histogram may be
changed by repeated the selection process.
	An XY profile plot may be produced by selecting on of the dash line
boxes in the upper left hand corner of the image window.  This puts the cursor
in a line selection mode.  Click the mouse on the image and then drag the 
mouse to the end point of the line.  When the mouse button is released, a 
profile plot will appear.  This profile plot may be changed by repeating the
selection process.
	Anotations on the image may be done by selecting one of the drawing
icons on the left and side and then drawing with the mouse on the image.
Color may be selected by clicking on one of the nine arrayed color cells on
the lower left hand corner of the image.  The color cells may be changed to 
any colors within the color bar (extreme left side) by sliding the triangle
along the color bar.   The Image/Options menubar allows the user to select
different pen widths to draw in.

	
WHITEBOARD:
	The whiteboard in collage is synonymous with a physical whiteboard.
multiple participant may draw on the whiteboard at the same time with different
color markers.  

	The whiteboard may be invoked by clicking on the main menubar in 
Tools/Whiteboard.  The whiteboard will appear on the other participants
display when a user draws in it.  A user may draw in the whiteboard by
selecting on one of the drawing tools in the upper left hand corner of the
whiteboard window.  The pencil icon will allow the user to draw in a free
hand mode similar to a pencil. The diagonal line will draw a line.  same
for the oval, rectangle, and arrow.  The toggle with the letter 'A' allows
the user to type in text.  A user Simply clicks on the toggle and then in the
whiteboard to place the cursor.  Text typed in from the keyboard will then
appear on the whiteboard.  Note, backspace (delete) does not work on text
in the whiteboard.

	A pen width may be selected for drawing in the whiteboard.  This is
done by selecting a pen width in the options menu of the whiteboard.

	Pen color may be selected several ways.  In the lower left corner
of the whiteboard is a set of 9 color selection buttons.  A user may
click on one of these colors to change the color that he will draw in.
Since collage support 8-bit color displays, there is actually 256 colors
that are available to be displayed at any one time.  A user may chose
anyone of these 256 by setting it to one of the 9 color selection
buttons.  A user simply clicks on the select button to set.  Along
the left side of the whiteboard is a color bar where all 256 colors are
displayed.  When the user clicks on one of these colors, it is then
inserted into the selected color selection buttons.  

	There are two toggle buttons for erase.  The one on the left is a
free hand erase.  The mouse cursor turns into a block eraser.  To erase a
portion of the whiteboard, simply click and drag the mouse over are to be
erased.  The eraser on the right is an area erase.  A user may rubber band
box an area on the whiteboard.  This is done by clicking in one corner of
an area to be erased and dragging the mouse to the opposite corner and then
releasing the mouse.  When the mouse is release the area selected will be
cleared.  There is also a clear whiteboard erase which will remove
everything from the whiteboard.  This button is located in the whiteboard
menu under the menu button Edit/Clear Whiteboard.
	
	This whiteboard supports screen captures inserted onto the
whiteboard.  This is useful if the user would like to incorporate something
on his screen into a drawing.  To do this, click on the Edit/Copy button
in the Whiteboard menubar.  When the button is released, the cursor will
change to the area selection cursor.  Select a portion of the screen to be
captured by rubberband boxing both corners.  To paste it into the whiteboard,
click on the Edit/Paste button in the Whiteboard menubar.  Next, the user
should click on the location in the whiteboard that he would like the
copied image to appear.  

	An 8-bit pseudo color system can only display 256 colors
out of all the colors that exist in the world at one time.  This set of 256
colors is referred to in collage as a palette.  Most loaded images have
a palette associated with it.  Collage also supports a palette editor for
creating new palettes.  The whiteboard allows the user to use any one of
the palettes that have been loaded into the session as the set of colors
for drawing in the whiteboard.  This may be done by selecting the Edit/Use
Palette option in the Whiteboard menubar.

	Each palette has 256 colors.  Out of these colors, the X display
uses some of these for things like window borders, backgrounds, xterm, etc.
Collage is concerned with the colors used for it's controls.  These colors
are allocated in the system palette which may be different from the palette
used for displaying images. Sometime there is a conflict with these palette
entries. By default, colllage will use the entire palette associated with
an image and then put back the lower 30 colors of the system palette.  This
is an attempt to preserve the motif colors as well as colors used by other
applications sharing the system palette.  This number 30 may be set at 
start up time in the user's .Xdefaults.  The resource name for this is
BasePixel.  So, to change this number to 48, in one's .Xdefaults, one would 
have a line like:

collage*BasePixel:	48

With some images, this may drastically affect the way the image is viewed
especially if a large portion of the image uses the low end values.  In the
Collage provides a method to use the entire palette associated with an
image.  This option may be turned on from the Edit/Use Entire Palette
toggle.  This toggle swaps out the system color map and restores the lower
range of colors to the palette.  This may have the affect of making the
Motif control panel difficult to see while color map focus is on the
window.  Turning off this toggle will restore the colors for this window.

PALETTE EDITOR:
	The palette editor is used to create or alter palettes.  To open the 
palette editor, click on the Windows/Palette Editor toggle from the main 
window menubar.  As described above, a palette is a set of 256 colors which 
is a subset of all possible colors (16,777,216).  The palette editor allows 
the user to change this subset of colors.  The palette editor has several 
ways of doing this.   
	Collage may have multiple palette loaded up at any time.  These
palettes may be associated with images that have been loaded up.  From
the palette editor, the user may select a palette to edit by clicking on
the named palette in the View menubar from the palette editor window.
Once clicked on, this palette will then be loaded ready to be edited.
	Clicking on the fiddle button will through the user into a fiddle 
mode.  In fiddle mode, the mouse is restricted to movements within the 
palette window.  Mouse movements are tracked and make realtime changes to
the palette.  Vertical movements of the palette perform a linear expansion
and compression on the palette.  Horizontal movements will shift the colors
to the left or right.  Clicking on the mouse button will end the fiddle
mode.  This feature is primarily for data analysis.  The dynamic nature
of this tool allows the user to easily shift the colors to get the most
color contrast out of a portion of an image of greatest interest.
	Color rotation may be performed by clicking on the color bar and
moving the mouse horizontally.
	The palette editor support color component maniupation.  This may
be done in one of three color models: 1) red,green,blue; 2) cyan, magenta,
yellow; hue, saturation, value.  The controls for the color components are
in the lower left corner of the palette editor.  The color components may
be displayed by clicking on the corresponding square toggle.  Clicking
on the diamond toggle will allow the user to change this component.
Multiple color components may be displayed, but only one component may be
manipulated at a time.  Once a color component is selected for change,
simply redraw the color component in the color component display window (
just below the color bar).  The upper region represents higher values.  As
the components are changed, the palette is updated.  Manipulating the color
components is a quick way to add new color to a range of the palette.
Other color models may be selected using the option toggle menu bar above
the color component selection toggles.
	In a collaborative session, the palettes are sent to the other
participants when the a manipulation is completed.  For example, while
doing the fiddle, the palette isn't sent until the user exits fiddle mode.
When manipulating a color component or rotating the palette, updates
are sent over when the mouse button is released.
	The 'Save As' button in the palette editor will save the palette to 
an HDF file.

PUBLISH / PRIVATE COPY
	Within collage it is possible to have a private copy of an image
that only the owner can see and operate on.  This may be done by either
loading up a data set before establishing a connection with other
collaborators, or clicking on the File/Private Copy button in the menubar
to make an image/whiteboard private.  If an image is private, it may 
be made public by clicking on the File/Publish button in the menubar.
This will send the image to all of the participants in the session.

PRINT
	The print command in collage allows a user to print an image or
text of the window from where the window it was invoked.  In the case
of an image, a PostScript file is generated in either Color or Greyscale.
The user has the option of sending this to the printer or saving it as
a file.  If a special print command is need for a particular system, it
may be specified in the print dialog box.  

SAVE

	In the case of a whiteboard or image, the save option will save
the data file from the window from which it was invoked into an HDF file.
In the case of a text window, the text will be saved as an ASCII file.

CLOSE
	The close button is like a stow button.  The data displayed in the
window from wich the close was invoked is not removed but taken from sight.
The window may be restored from the main collage window menu option
'Windows'.

SCREEN CAPTURE
	The screen capture capability of collage is a very useful tool
for showing other participants other applications that are running
on ones screen.  The screen capture will grab a selected portion of the
users screen and send it as a raster image to the other participants.
This raster image may then be annotated in the same fashion that images
or whiteboard may be.  This function is invoked from the main collage
window under the menu Tools/Screen Capture.  Once this menubutton is
clicked, the cursor turns into the area selection cursor.  The user
then clicks on one corner of the are that he would like to select and
then drags the mouse to the opposite corner (rubber band boxing) and
then releases.  When the mouse button is released, the image is sent
to the other participants including the person who sent it.

CHAT BOX
	The Chat Box is used for communicating with other users by typing.
Although it is recommended to use collage with a telephone, the chat box
may be used when the use of a telephone is not an option.  The chat box
may be opened from the Tools/Chat Box menu button in the main menu box.
Or, it will open automatically when another participant sends a message.
Messages are sent by typing them in the 'Input:' box of the chat box.
The messages are sent when the user hits <Return>.  The 'Chat Session:'
box displays a log of all the messages sent in the session.  Each line
of a message is preceded by the person's name who sent the message.


ANIMATIONS
	An animation consists of a sequence of image viewed over time 
similar to a video.  An animation file may be loaded up from the collage
man window File/Open Animation menu button.  Collage supports animations
of multiple 2d frames stored in an HDF file.  Collage also supports
animating through a 3d cube of data.  The user should first select the
type of animation desired.  This is done in the Options menu of the main
collage window.  
	Collage supports three type of animations.  The choice
is made based on the resources of the machine the user will be viewing the
animations and the size of the animation.  The Option/Animate from server
memory will cause the frames of the animation to be read in and sent over
to the X Window server and stored locally on the server side.  This type
of animation is by far the fastest since no transfer time is required
between flipping to the next frame.  However, it also consumes enough
memory on the X server to store the entire animation.  This may not be
an option with some X servers that have small amounts of memory. 
The Option/Animate from memory will cause the frames to be read in and 
stored in the collage client memory. This options save the time of having 
to read in each frame before being displayed, but there is a delay when 
the image is sent to the X server.  The last option Option/Animate from 
disk tells collage that when it is animating, it will read each frame from 
disk and then send it over to X server to be displayed.  This option is the 
slowest but also consumes the least memory resources.  This option is ideal 
for extremely large animations.
	To load an animation, the user first selects the file
to be animated.  After the file has been selected, the HDF file browser
will open.  In the case of multiple 2d frames,  the user will need to 
select all of the frames to be animated.  This is best done by clicking
on the Raster Image Group toggle (RIG) on the left.  This will filter
out the HDF objects the HDF file so that only the raster image groups
are displayed.  Click and drag so that all of the images desired are
selected.  If the user desires to skip some frames, he may hold down
the control button while selecting the objects with the mouse.
When all of the raster image frames are selected, click on the 
Transport/Send Selection menubutton in the HDF browser menubar. 
The animation window will then appear and the frames will be displayed
as the animation is loaded into memory and sent to the other
collaborators.
	The animation controls work much like a video casette recorder or
CD player.  There is a play button (the triangle), a pause button 
(to vertical parallel lines), a single frame step (triangle with a bar).
There is also a reverse play and reverse single step denoted by a triangle
in the reverse direction.  Below these controls is a horizontal scroll bar
which shows the user where in the animation the current frame is.  The user
may grab this scroll bar with the mouse and move further into the animation
or back.  In the lower right is a vertical scroll bar which controls speed
of play.
	In the Options menu of the animation window contains options for 
type of animation play.  By default the animation is a 'Single Run' animation
which means that the animation will stop when it gets to the end.  The user
may set this to a 'Continuous Wrap' where the animation loops back to the
beginning when it reaches the end, or set this to a 'Continuous Bounce'
where the animation will play in reverse when it reaches the end.
Also in the Options menu is a toggle for displaying the frame number on the
animation.  The frame number will appear in the lower left corner.
	While in a collaborative session, the animations are only
synchonzied at certain points.  When the animation starts, stops, or single
frame advances, all collaborators are viewing the same frame.  Also,
all collaborators will be viewing the same type of animation (ie Single
Run, Continuous Bounce, or Continuous Wrap).  Animations will be played
at the fastest speed possible or selected for each display.  This means
that faster machines will be able to run through the animation quicker.
All participants are synchronized to the same frame when the animation stops.


TEXT EDITOR
	Collage supports a simple text editor which is designed to
collaboratively edit a text file with other participants.  Because use of
particular text editor borders on religious issues, there was no attempt
made in making an editor that people would want to develop documents in.
	The text editor supports sharing of highlights.  This is a useful
feature for pointing out paragraphs in the text.  Scrolling is done
independently from other participants so that each user may read a
different part at a time.  Scrolling is synchronized when a portion of text
is selected.  Changes to the text may be done by any of the participants.
One note:  the text editor does not yet have a locking mechanism.  It is
necessary for only one person to be editing at a time or else the text
source may get out of synch.
	The text editor does support the drawing functions mentioned in
the whiteboard section of this document.  Drawings appear in the overlay
play and do not affect the text.  Further, as of release 1.2 drawing in
the text overlay plane is only supported on the Unix/X versions (not Mac or
PC).

COMMAND LINE ARGS FOR COLLAGE:

	-load filename	[filename ...]
		when collage is started up, it will load up the 
		specified file(s).  In the case of a GIF or XWD file, it will
		load up the first image.  In the case of an HDF file, if
		ther is only one image, it will load this image up into the
		single image display.  If there are multiple images, it
		will load them all into the animation window.

	-DTMIN	host:port 	
		specifies a DTM in port.

	-DTMOUT host:port
		specifies a DTM out port.  This may be used to connect
		to the collage_server on start up rather than specifying
		it through the menu interface.


COLLAGE INTERNALS:
DTM:
	Collage uses the DTM (Data Transfer Mechanism) as it's protocol
for communicating over the network.  In a collaborative session collage 
communicates with other collage clients via the collage server.  Other 
clients such as data analysis tools, simulations may send data to the 
collage session to be viewed.  
	The following assumes the reader has a programming level 
understanding of the DTM library.  Documentation for DTM as well as source
may be found on the NCSA anonymous ftp server ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.
The following information is for those who wish to send collage data.

	A collage client has one DTM inport and one DTM outport.  These
ports may be specified at startup time with the command line args
-DTMIN :port/-DTMOUT host:port.  When collage connects to a remote process
via DTM it will handshake with an SRV class message. The SRV message class
is for establishing a connection within a collaborative session.  The
"message is, "I'm connecting to you, here is my userID, and my inport".
When the server receives this connection, it will be on it's global inport.
The server sets up a separate inport and outport for each client.  The 
return message from the server will be "ok, change your outport to this
address".  The new address passed back will be a special inport on the
server just for reading incoming messages from this client.  The client
will then close it's outport to the server and then reconnect to the new
port that the server has given it. The same innitial connection sent by the
client is sent to the server.   At this point connection is established
with the server.  This arbitrartion is only necessary with a client that
will be participating as a collaborator in the collage session.  For a
client that will just be sending data, this arbitration is not necessary.
	The collage clients may receive any DTM class.  Any class that it
doesn't understand, it ignores.  The DTM classes collage currently
understands is:
		DTM release:
	
		RIS8:	for raster images
		SDS:	scientific data sets (n dimensional array's of any type)
		PAL:	8 bit palettes
		MSG:	sending messages (chat box)
	
		Collage specific: (several of these will be integrated
				into DTM 2.4)
		COL:	selections & doodles (no longer sends as of 1.2
					only recieves)
		DOL:	selection & doodles (new to 1.2)
		SRV:	for establishing/closing connections
		ANIM:	animation commands
		TXT:	sending text editing messages


	Each of these classes has the additional field of a userID of the
sender set with XXXsetID("namehere").  
	When sending RIS8 and SDS, usually a palette is associated with
the image.  After the RIS8 or SDS has been sent, the palette is sent with
an associated tag in the header.  COLsetAssoc(header,"name of data associated")
will let the receiver know that this pal should be used when displaying the
image.  The associated tag is also used when a data set and an image are 
related.  This will cause selection in collage to appear on both the image
and dataset.
	Animations are sent across as 2d SDS.  The DTM header is marked
"to be treated as an animation".  This is done with the
ANIMmarkAnimation(header) call.  This will cause collage to put the SDS in
an animation window rather than a single frame window.  Additional
frames with the same name and animation mark will be appended to the
animation sequence in the order that they are received.
	The source distribution of collage comes with the DTM extensions,
some of the DTM routines used to communicate will collage will be found in
there.  Additionally, if interested in seeing collage communication source,
see the module net.c.  This module is highly portable and has been added
to several NCSA data analysis tools easily so as to allow them to
communicate with collage.
