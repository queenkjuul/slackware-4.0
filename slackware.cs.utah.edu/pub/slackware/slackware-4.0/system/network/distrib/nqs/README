	This is the official home of Sheffield-NQS, a project funded by
	JISC's New Technologies Initiative.
	
	The directory `Monsanto-NQS' contains a copy of NQS, developed by
	John Roman at Monsanto Software.  Currently, we only support this
	version of NQS.  If you are looking to provide an NQS service now,
	you should use Monsanto-NQS.  We will release bug fixes to Monsanto
	in the future.
	
	The directory `Sheffield-NQS' will eventually contain a copy of the
	new Sheffield-derivative of Monsanto.  Please do not download this
	unless you are willing to actively support its development - we
	cannot provide support for Sheffield-NQS yet.
	
	The directory `doc' contains copies of all the information, reports
	and anything else to do with NQS which I've either written, or found
	on-line.  All of this documentation is also available on the Web :
	
	http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/projects/nqs/NQS.home.contents.html

	The directory 'tools' contains incidental software developed to help
	this project along.
	
	Finally, there are two active electronic mailing lists - more
	information can be found in doc/NQS.home.txt
