The first production release of Monsanto-NQS in six months, this version
incorporates a large number of bug fixes and improved support for various
platforms.<P>

Unfortunately, v3.37.0 didn't compile, due to an email header I forgot to
delete, so this release is just a stupidity fix.<P>

</UL>

<B>PLEASE NOTE</B> that there will be <B>NO MORE</B> releases under the name
Monsanto-NQS. The next release will be Generic NQS v3.40.0.  Until this is
available, we recommend that new users use Monsanto-NQS v3.37.1.<P>
