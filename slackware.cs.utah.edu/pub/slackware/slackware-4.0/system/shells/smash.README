i am currently working on getline support (hopefully done w/in the
next two weeks; i've got two programming projects due, one of
which i should be working on as i type this.).  I'm using getline
'cause it's smaller, but it will make the shell not as small as it
could possibly be, so i'll still keep the bare input functions there.
getline allows Smash to have a much nicer command line (with editing,
scrolling trough history, etc.
