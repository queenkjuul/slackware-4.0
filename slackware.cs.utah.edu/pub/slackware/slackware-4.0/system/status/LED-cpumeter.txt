meter - an LED cpu metering application for Linux machines
Written by Richard Laxton ( u2105546@cumulus.csd.unsw.oz.au )

This program uses the hardware described in the included file "led-stat.txt"
to create a CPU meter that displays on eight LEDs connected to your parallel
port. The code to gather cpu statistics was modified from code written by Mike
Romberg as part of Xosview. Here is the copyright included from that code.

To compile just run "make". A precompiled version is already included.
Note that the resulting code will only work if "make" is run as root. This
is because the code makes use of direct I/O calls that must be executed as
root. Once compiled, the program "meter" is set up as a setuid program so
can be run by anyone and work.

Happy Hacking.
